<p>Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly and Annotation of the Fiber Flax (<em>Linum usitatissimum</em>) Genome</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Genome Assembly</strong></p>
<p>The HiFi long reads were assembled by <strong>Hifiasm</strong> v0.13-r308 with the <strong>default parameters</strong>. Then the <strong>HiFi reads were mapped back to the assembly</strong> to generate a <strong>coverage distribution plot</strong> using <strong>minimap2</strong> 2.17-r941. According to the <strong>covering depth</strong>, <strong>purge_dups</strong> v1.2.5 (Guan et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473814/#B22">2020</a>) was applied to <strong>remove redundant haplotigs</strong>. The <strong>Juicer v1.6</strong> (Durand et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473814/#B15">2016</a>) and <strong>3D-DNA</strong> v180922 (Dudchenko et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473814/#B13">2017</a>) pipelines were used to process the <strong>Hi-C data and scaffold the assembly</strong>. The results were polished using the <strong>Juicebox Assembly Tools</strong> v1.11.08 (Dudchenko et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473814/#B14">2018</a>). The CDC Bethune v2 assembly has made most use of the long continuity of optical maps. To further improve the accuracy of order and orient in our assembly, we integrated information from the <strong>Hi-C scaffolding</strong> and the CDC Bethune v2 assembly using the ALLMAPS pipeline (Tang et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473814/#B55">2015b</a>) implemented in jcvi utility libraries (Tang et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473814/#B54">2015a</a>).</p>

<p>A chromosome-level genome assembly of rugged rose (<em>Rosa rugosa</em>) provides insights into its evolution, ecology, and floral characteristics</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Genome assembly and quality evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 59.2 Gb of raw HiFi sequencing reads was obtained from the rosa DNA library. We first used <strong>HiCanu</strong> v2.2.1 for preliminary assembly of the rosa genome. Then, <strong>Redundans</strong> v 0.14a<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213826/#CR27">27</a> was performed to <strong>remove the redundant sequences</strong>. A total of 150.6 Gb of <strong>Hi-C data</strong> were obtained to <strong>anchor</strong> the contig onto the chromosome. We <strong>aligned Hi-C</strong> reads to assembly by <strong>BWA</strong> v 0.7.17-r1188<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213826/#CR28">28</a>. Next, the <strong>draft assembly genome</strong> was <strong>scaffolded with Hi-C reads by 3D-DNA</strong> v180114<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213826/#CR29">29</a>. Then, <strong>Juicer</strong> was used to <strong>filter the sequence and cluster it</strong>, and the <strong>Juicerbox tool</strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213826/#CR30">30</a> was applied to <strong>manually adjust chromosome construction</strong>. We finally <strong>anchored the scaffolds on seven chromosomes</strong>. In addition, the <strong>BUSCO</strong> v3.0.2pipeline was used to assess the completeness and accuracy of the <em>R. rugosa</em> genome with the embryophyte_odb10 dataset, which contains 1614 BUSCO gene sets.</p>

<p>Haplotype-Resolved Genome Analyses Reveal Genetically Distinct Nuclei within a Commercial Cultivar of <em>Lentinula edodes</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Genome Sequencing and Assembly</strong></p>
<p>SMRTbell libraries were sequenced on a PacBio Sequel II system, and consensus reads (HiFi reads) were generated using ccs software (<a href="https://github.com/pacificbiosci-ences/unanimity">https://github.com/pacificbiosci-ences/unanimity</a>, accessed on 22 December 2021) with the parameter “–inPasses 3”. We generated 8.65 Gb and 5.35 Gb PacBio HiFi reads of SP3 and SP30, respectively. These long (~15 kb) and highly accurate (&gt;99%) HiFi reads were assembled using <strong>HiCanu</strong> [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8877449/#B18-jof-08-00167">18</a>] for both strains with <strong>default parameters</strong>.</p>
<p>The vegetative mycelia of SP3 and SP30 were also used to generate Hi-C DNA libraries at the Frasergen Enterprise (Wuhan, China). The Hi-C libraries were quantified and sequenced on the Illumina Nova-seq platform (San Diego, CA, USA). The chimeric fragments from the original cross-linked long-distance physical interactions were then isolated and processed into libraries. For anchored contigs, 34,909,404 and 31,267,524 clean <strong>reads</strong> were generated from the Hi-C library and were <strong>mapped</strong> to the SP3 and SP30 <strong>preliminary assembly</strong> using <strong>Juicer</strong> [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8877449/#B20-jof-08-00167">20</a>] with default parameters. Paired reads mapped to different contigs were used for the Hi-C associated scaffolding. Self-ligated, non-ligated, and other invalid reads were filtered out. We applied <strong>3D-DNA</strong> to <strong>order</strong> and <strong>orient</strong> the clustered contigs. Then, <strong>Juicer</strong> was used to filter the sequences and cluster them, and the <strong>Juicebox</strong> was applied to <strong>adjust chromosome construction manually</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8877449/#app1-jof-08-00167">Figure S2</a>). We finally <strong>anchored the scaffolds on ten chromosomes</strong>. In addition, the BUSCO v3.0.231 pipeline was used to assess the completeness and accuracy of the SP3 and SP30 genomes.</p>

<p>Benchmarking of next and third generation sequencing technologies and their associated algorithms for <em>de novo</em> genome assembly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Genome assembly</strong> </p>
<p>In order to assess the hybrid assembly strategy, the present study chose to evaluate two pipelines, MaSuRCA (version 3.3.5) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b27-mmr-0-0-11890">27</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b28-mmr-0-0-11890">28</a>) and Wengan (version 0.1) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b29-mmr-0-0-11890">29</a>). MaSuRCA workflow offers three different assemblers, CABOG (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b30-mmr-0-0-11890">30</a>), SOAPdenovo (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b31-mmr-0-0-11890">31</a>) and Flye (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b32-mmr-0-0-11890">32</a>). The pipeline was tested using CABOG and Flye assemblers, which are designed for long-read assembly. Wengan pipeline is based on DiscovarDenovo assembler (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b33-mmr-0-0-11890">33</a>).</p>
<p>Canu (version 2.0) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b34-mmr-0-0-11890">34</a>) is a long-read assembler, designed to use long high-noise single-molecule sequencing data, such as Nanopore and PacBio reads. Its workflow is based on the Celera assembler (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b35-mmr-0-0-11890">35</a>) which was used in the Human Genome Project to produce the first draft of the human genome. <strong>Hifiasm</strong> (version 0.13) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b36-mmr-0-0-11890">36</a>) and <strong>HiCanu</strong> (Canu version 2.1.1) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b37-mmr-0-0-11890">37</a>) are long-read assemblers exclusively <strong>for HiFi reads.</strong> The <strong>main difference</strong> between HiFi assemblers and the ones mentioned previously, is that <strong>Hifiasm and HiCanu produce phased assemblies</strong>. A phased assembly is a <strong>haplotype-resolved assembly</strong>, where <strong>high complexity regions</strong>, such as <strong>genes</strong>, will be <strong>separated into two different alleles</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b36-mmr-0-0-11890">36</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b38-mmr-0-0-11890">38</a>). HiCanu is a modified version of Canu, adapted to take advantage of the characteristics of HiFi reads. <strong>Hifiasm</strong> produces <strong>two different files</strong> for the <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>alternative</strong> assembly, whereas <strong>HiCanu</strong> <strong>combines</strong> the <strong>primary and the alternative</strong> assembly in the <strong>same FASTA file</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffolding</strong> </p>
<p>In order to test the necessity of scaffolding, a scaffolder was used to improve the assembly <strong>continuity</strong> and <strong>completeness</strong>, as follows: <strong>Hi-C data are mapped</strong> to the <strong>primary assembly</strong> by <strong>Arima</strong> mapping pipeline (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b39-mmr-0-0-11890">39</a>), to produce a BAM file which is consequently converted to a BED file. <strong>SALSA</strong> (version 2.2) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893683/#b40-mmr-0-0-11890">40</a>) uses this BED file which contains the mapping information of Hi-C reads on the assembly, <strong>to scaffold</strong> the primary assembly.</p>

<p>PacBio HiFi reads were independently assembled using Hifiasm and Canu, with respective N50 values of 31.3 and 17 Mbp (Table <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-tbl-0002">2</a>). Both HiFi assemblies <strong>contained single contigs that spanned the full length of the SL4.0 reference chromosome 5</strong> (Figure <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#support-information-section">S1</a>). We checked for the completeness of the assembly of gene sequences by Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis which showed both assemblies were almost gene complete (both 98.4%), slightly improving upon the SL4.0 genome and comparable to the <em>S. pimpinellifolium</em> ‘LA2093’ genome.</p>
<p><strong>Hifiasm</strong> v0.14.2 (Cheng et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0013">2021</a>) was used to assemble the HiFi reads with default settings. Canu v2.1.1 was used to assemble the HiFi reads in ‘HiCanu’ mode (Nurk et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0050">2020</a>) with an estimated genome size of 916 Mbp based on kmer counting of the raw HiFi data using Jellyfish v2.2.6 (Marçais &amp; Kingsford, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0044">2011</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Quast</strong> v5.0.2 (Mikheenko et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0047">2018</a>) and GAAS v1.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/GAAS">https://github.com/NBISweden/GAAS</a>) were used to <strong>calculate statistics on fasta files</strong>. BUSCO was calculated using BUSCO v5.2.1 (Seppey et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0068">2019</a>) depending on hmmsearch v3.1, and metaeuk v4.a0f584d was used with lineage datasets solanales (<a href="https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/solanales_odb10.2020-08-05.tar.gz">https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/solanales_odb10.2020-08-05.tar.gz</a>) and eudicots (<a href="https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/eudicots_odb10.2020-09-10.tar.gz">https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/eudicots_odb10.2020-09-10.tar.gz</a>) to obtain evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content. To assess the LAI, LTR retriever v2.9.0 (Ou et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0051">2018</a>) was run with default settings on the respective genome assemblies.</p>
<p>We ran one single round of <strong>Salsa</strong> v2.2 (Ghurye et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15690#tpj15690-bib-0026">2019</a>) with optional settings: <strong>-e DNASE -m yes -p yes</strong>.</p>
<p>A modified version of the <strong>convert.sh</strong> script was used to convert the Salsa2 output to a Hi-C file, which was used within a local installation of <strong>Juicebox</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox">https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox</a>) v1.11.08 to generate a <strong>Hi-C contact plot.</strong></p>

<p><strong>HiFi sequencing and assembly</strong></p>
<p>Sequencing was performed on a PacBio Sequel II instrument with Sequencing Primer V2 and Sequel II Binding Kit 2.0 at the Genome Center of Grandomics. A total of 22.90 Gb of HiFi reads with ∼157 × coverage were generated, and N50 of the reads was 15,424 bp. HiFi reads were assembled using <strong>hifiasm</strong> v. 0.14-r312 [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022921001741?via=ihub#b0085">17]</a>with <strong>default parameters</strong>, and the <strong>gfatools</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/lh3/gfatools">https://github.com/lh3/gfatools</a>) was used to convert sequence graphs in the <strong>GFA to FASTA</strong> format.</p>

<p>We assembled the genome of the big berry manzanita following a <strong>protocol</strong> adapted from <strong>Rhie et al</strong>. (2021) as part of the CCGP assembly efforts. The CCGP assembly protocol version 1.0 uses PacBio <strong>HiFi</strong> reads and <strong>Hi-C</strong> chromatin capture data for the generation of high-quality and highly contiguous nuclear genome assemblies. The output corresponding to a diploid assembly consists of <strong>two pseudo haplotypes</strong> (<strong>primary</strong> and <strong>alternate</strong>). The <strong>primary</strong> assembly is <strong>more complete</strong> and consists of <strong>longer phased blocks</strong>. The <strong>alternate</strong> consists of <strong>haplotigs</strong> (contigs of clones with the same haplotype) in <strong>heterozygous regions</strong> and is not as complete and more fragmented. Given the characteristics of the latter, it <strong>cannot be considered on its own</strong> but as <strong>a complement of the primary assembly</strong> (<a href="https://lh3.github.io/2021/04/17/concepts-in-phased-assemblies">https://lh3.github.io/2021/04/17/concepts-in-phased-assemblies</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/help/definitions/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/help/definitions/</a>).</p>
<p>To generate this assembly, we <strong>removed remnant adapter</strong> sequences from the PacBio HiFi dataset using <strong>HiFiAdapterFilt</strong> and assembled the initial set of contigs with the filtered PacBio reads using <strong>HiFiasm</strong> (see Table 1 for assembly pipeline and relevant software). Next, we <strong>identified sequences corresponding to haplotypic duplications and contig overlaps</strong> on the <strong>primary assembly</strong> with <strong>purge_dups</strong> [Version 1.0.1] (Guan et al. 2020) and transferred them to the alternate assembly. We a<strong>ligned the Hi-C data</strong> to both <strong>primary and alternate assemblies</strong> using the <strong>Arima Genomics Mapping Pipeline</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline">https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline</a>) and <strong>scaffolded</strong> the genomes using <strong>SALSA</strong> [Version 2, options –e GATCGATC] (Ghurye et al. 2017; Ghurye et al. 2019). We <strong>closed the generated gaps</strong> in both <strong>assemblies</strong> using the PacBio <strong>HiFi</strong> reads and <strong>YAGCloser</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/merlyescalona/yagcloser">https://github.com/merlyescalona/yagcloser</a>). The <strong>primary assembly</strong> was <strong>manually curated</strong> by <strong>iteratively generating and analyzing</strong> Hi-C <strong>contact maps</strong>. To generate the contact maps, we <strong>aligned</strong> the <strong>Hi-C</strong> data against the corresponding reference with <strong>bwa</strong> mem, identified ligation junctions, and generated <strong>Hi-C pairs</strong> using <strong>pairtools</strong> [Version 0.3.0] (Goloborodko et al. 2018). We generated a multi-resolution <strong>Hi-C matrix</strong> in binary form with <strong>cooler</strong> [Version 0.8.10] (Abdennur and Mirny 2020) and balanced it with <strong>hicExplorer</strong> [Version 3.6] (Ramírez et al. 2018). We used <strong>HiGlass</strong> [Version 2.1.11] (Kerpedjiev et al. 2018) and the <strong>PretextSuite</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView">https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView</a>; <a href="https://github.com/wtsihpag/PretextMap">https://github.com/wtsihpag/PretextMap</a>; <a href="https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextSnapshot">https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextSnapshot</a>) to <strong>visualize the contact maps</strong>. Assemblies were then checked for contamination using the <strong>BlobToolKit Framework</strong> [Version 2.3.3] (Challis et al. 2020), and <strong>trimmed</strong> for remnants of sequence adaptors and <strong>mitochondrial</strong> contamination.</p>

<p><strong>Mitochondrial Genome Assembly</strong></p>
<p>We identified <strong>a subset of mitochondrial reads from the PacBio HiFi</strong> dataset using <strong>BLAST+</strong>  by identifying regions of similarity between the reads and the mitochondrial <strong>(mito) database</strong> (NCBI). These mitochondrial reads were used as input in <strong>HiFiasm</strong> [Version 0.13-r308] to generate the <strong>mitochondrial</strong> <strong>assembly</strong>. Given the circularity of the mitochondrial genome, we carried out self-alignment of the sequence using <strong>lastz</strong> [Version 1.04.08] (Harris 2007) to <strong>manually identify and remove duplicated regions</strong>. We aligned the subset of mitochondrial reads to the assembly using <strong>raptor</strong> [Version 0.20.3-171e0f1] (<a href="https://github.com/isovic/raptor">https://github.com/isovic/raptor</a>) and <strong>polished</strong> it with <strong>racon</strong> [Version 1.14.] (<a href="https://github.com/isovic/racon">https://github.com/isovic/racon</a>). We searched for <strong>matches</strong> of the resulting <strong>mitochondrial assembly</strong> sequence in the nuclear genome assembly using <strong>BLAST+</strong> and <strong>filtered out scaffolds from the nuclear genome</strong> with a percentage of <strong>sequence identity &gt;99%</strong> and <strong>size smaller than the mitochondrial assembly sequence</strong>. From the <strong>subset of mitochondrial reads</strong> used for the assembly, we analyzed the <strong>BLAST</strong> output and <strong>the species of the closest mitochondrial sequence</strong> available in the NCBI GenBank database, <em>Vaccinium macrocarpon</em> (Accession number: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023338.1">NC_023338.1</a>). We used the mitochondrial assembly of <em>V. macrocarpon</em> as a <strong>guide</strong> for the <strong>mitochondrial gene annotation</strong> generated with <strong>MitoFinder</strong> [Version 1.4] (Allio et al. 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Chloroplast Genome Assembly</strong></p>
<p>We identified chloroplast reads from the PacBio HiFi dataset with BLAST+ using the plastids RefSeq genomes [v4.1] (O’Leary et al. 2016). From this subset, we analyzed the matches and identified the species of the closest chloroplast sequence available in the NCBI database as <em>Camellia taliensis</em> (NC_022264.1). Next, we found matches of the <em>C. taliensis</em> chloroplast genome sequence in the nuclear genome assembly with BLAST+ and filtered out scaffolds from the nuclear genome assembly with length smaller than the <em>C. taliensis</em> length, sequence identity &gt;90%, and <em>e</em>-value &lt;0.00001. We aligned the filtered scaffolds to the <em>C. taliensis</em> chloroplast genome with minimap2 (Li 2018) and generated a consensus sequence with bcftools (Li 2011). We manually curated the sequence using lastz. Finally, we polished the last assembly version using raptor and racon and annotated it using the web platform GeSeq (Tillich et al. 2017).</p>

<p>We now report the use of <strong>HiFiasm</strong> to assemble the genome of Macadamia jansenii, a genome that has been used as a model to test sequencing and assembly. This achieved <strong>almost complete chromosome level assembly</strong> from the sequence data alone <strong>without</strong> the need for <strong>higher level chromosome map information</strong>. <strong>Eight of the 14 chromosomes were represented by a single large contig</strong> (six with telomere repeats at both ends) and the <strong>other six assembled from two to four main contigs</strong>. The small number of chromosome breaks appears to be the result of <strong>highly repetitive regions</strong> including ribosomal genes that cannot be assembled by these approaches. </p>

<p><strong>HiFiasm assembly</strong></p>
<p>For assembly, <strong>24 core</strong> processing units and <strong>120 Gb of memory</strong> was employed. Default settings of the HiFiasm assembler were used to assemble heterozygous genomes with <strong>built-in duplication purging parameters</strong>. The HiFiasm output directory consists of two haploid (1 and 2), one primary contig and one alternate haplotig GFA graph files. Each halplotig and one primary contig GFA file was converted to FASTA format using the <strong>awk</strong> command.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of assembly</strong></p>
<p>The primary HiFiasm assembly of <em>M. jansenii</em> included 779 contigs that were categorised into three subsets: (i) contigs &lt;1 Mb size; (ii) contigs &lt;1 Mb and more than 100 kb size; and (iii) contigs &lt;100 kb size. Along with the <strong>main primary and two haploid assemblies</strong>, all <strong>three</strong> sets of primary contig subsets were <strong>passed</strong> through analysis using <strong>quast</strong> (Gurevich et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0010">2013</a>), <strong>busco</strong> (Simão et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0028">2015</a>) and <strong>repeatmodeler</strong> (Humann et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0012">2019</a>). The <strong>telomere sequences</strong> in the HiFiasm <strong>contigs</strong> were identified using the <strong>bioserf platform</strong> (<a href="https://bioserf.org/">https://bioserf.org</a>) (Somanathan and Baysdorfer, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0029">2018</a>). <strong>Ribosomal RNA</strong> and <strong>other protein coding genes</strong> at the <strong>terminal</strong> end of the HiFiasm contigs were identified using an <strong>ncbi blast search</strong> (<a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Ribosomal RNA in the contigs was identified using <strong>Barrnap</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap">https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap</a>) (Seemann, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0023">2013</a>) with default settings for eukaryotes.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with Hi-C assembly</strong></p>
<p>The HiFiasm contigs were compared with the <em>M. jansenii</em> 14 pseudo-molecules from the Hi-C assembly (Sharma et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0026">2021b</a>) using the online interactive D-Genies dotplot tool (Cabanettes and Klopp, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0003">2018</a>) to <strong>compare two genomes using Minimap2</strong> and, for <strong>alignments</strong>, dotplot images were created after selecting the ‘sort contigs’ option, selecting the ‘minimum identity’ parameter at 0.75 and checking the ‘strong precision’ tick box.</p>
<p><strong>Characterisation of organelle genomes content of HiFiasm contigs</strong></p>
<p>A reference <font color="red"><strong>mitochondrial</strong> genome, <strong>chloroplast</strong> genome and <strong>nuclear ribosomal RNA</strong> sequence</font> from this sample were assembled from <strong>Illumina raw reads</strong> (Murigneux et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0020">2020</a>) using the <strong>GetOrganelle toolkit</strong> (Jin et al., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15583#tpj15583-bib-0013">2020</a>) with default parameters. The <strong>HiFiasm contigs</strong> (779) were <strong>compared with</strong> the <strong>organellar and ribosomal sequences</strong> in dotplots.</p>

<p><strong>Genome survey and assembly</strong><br>A total of 89.12 Gb of high-quality paired-end reads were obtained by <strong>Illumina</strong> genomic sequencing (~70.35X coverage, Table S1). The genome size, heterozygosity and repeat content were estimated based on k-mer distribution using <strong>21-mers</strong> extracted from the Illumina short reads. The estimated genome size was further validated using <strong>flow cytometr</strong>y. A total of 223.91 Gb raw PacBio subreads were filtered and corrected using pbccs pipeline with default parameters (<a href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs</a>). The resulted CCS reads were subjected to hifiasm for de novo assembly. We <font color="red"><strong>corrected</strong> the <strong>primary contigs</strong> by the <strong>Pilon</strong></font> (version1.18) (Utturkar, Klingeman, Hurt, &amp; Brown, 2017) program <strong>using 89.12 Gb (70.35×) of Illumina paired-end reads</strong>. BWA (version0.7.10-r789) (Li, 2013) and SAMtools (version1.9) (Li et al., 2009) were used for reads alignment and SAM/BAM format conversion. <strong>BUSCO</strong> (version3.0) (Simao, Waterhouse, Ioannidis, Kriventseva, &amp; Zdobnov, 2015) program with embryophyta_odb10 database were used to assess the completeness of genome and gene annotation .</p>
<p><strong>Chromosome assembly using Hi-C</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 96.4 Gb of Hi-C data were generated. The raw data were filtered using perl script as implemented in the software <strong>LACHESIS</strong> (Burton et al., 2013). BWA software was used to <strong>map the Hi-C reads to the draft assembly</strong> and <strong>uniquely mapped reads were selected for furtheranalysis</strong>. We further applied our newly developed <strong>ALLHiC pipeline</strong> to link the contigs into <strong>nine pseudo-chromosomes</strong>. <strong>HiC-pro</strong> (version2.10.0) (Servant et al., 2015) program was used to <strong>calculate Hi-C mapping rate and evaluate the quality of Hi-C scaffolding</strong>.</p>

<p>Overall, a final genome assembly of 705.51 Mb with contig and scaffold N50 values of 20.89 and 24.73 Mb, respectively, was obtained. Of these contigs, 95.89% had unique locations on 29 chromosomes.</p>
<p><strong>Genome Assembly and Polish</strong></p>
<p>After quality control of raw reads, the pass reads were used for <em>de novo</em> genome assembly of using an <strong>OLC (overlap layout-consensus)/string graph method</strong> with NextDenovo (v2.3.0) with reads_cutoff:1 k and seed_cutoff:30 k. Firstly, self-correction of the original subreads was finished by NextCorrect to obtain consistent sequences (CNS reads). Then, CNS reads were used to obtain preliminary assembly through NextGraph (default parameter). The ONT, CCS and Hi-C data were used to correct the preliminary assembly using Racon (v1.3.1, default, CCS data) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B66">Vaser et al., 2017</a>)and Nextpolish (v1.2.4, default, ONT and Hi-C data) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B24">Hu et al., 2020</a>). <strong>BlastN was used to check the genome contamination</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#s10">Supplementary information S2</a>).</p>
<p>Completeness of the genome assembly was assessed using <strong>BUSCO</strong> v4.0.5 (Benchmarking universal Single-Copy Orthologs) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B58">Simao et al., 2015</a>) and CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Gene Mapping Approach) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B55">Parra et al., 2007</a>). <strong>To evaluate the accuracy of the assembly</strong>, all <strong>paired-end reads were mapped to the assembled</strong> genome using <strong>BWA</strong>  (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B39">Li and Durbin, 2010</a>) and the <strong>mapping rate</strong> and the genome coverage of sequencing reads were both assessed using SAMtools v0.1.1855 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B40">Li et al., 2009</a>). In addition, the base accuracy of the assembly was calculated using bcftools (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B13">Danecek and Mccarthy, 2017</a>). Coverage of the expressed genes of the assembly was examined by aligning all the RNA-seq reads against the assembly using HISAT with default parameters. <strong>To ensure that mitochondrial sequences were not included in the assembly,</strong> the draft genome assembly was submitted to the <strong>NT library</strong> and matching sequences were eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Genome Anchoring to Chromosome</strong></p>
<p>The read quality (370 million paired-end reads) was controlled using Hi-C-Pro. Firstly low-quality sequences (quality scores &lt;20), adaptor sequences, and sequences shorter than 30 bp were filtered out using <strong>fastp</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B10">Chen et al., 2018</a>). Next, clean reads were mapped to the draft assembled sequence using <strong>bowtie2</strong> (v2.3.2) (-end-to-end –very-sensitive -L 30) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B37">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</a>) to obtain the unique mapped paired-end reads. Invalid read pairs were filtered using <strong>HiC-Pro</strong> (v2.8.1) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8589036/#B57">Servant et al., 2015</a>). The scaffolds were further <strong>clustered, ordered, and oriented onto chromosomes</strong> by <strong>LACHESIS</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/shendurelab/LACHESIS">https://github.com/shendurelab/LACHESIS</a>), with parameters <strong>CLUSTER_MIN_RE_SITES = 100, CLUSTER_MAX_LINK_DENSITY = 2.5, CLUSTER NONINFORMATIVE RATIO = 1.4, ORDER MIN N RES IN TRUNK = 60, ORDER MIN N RES IN SHREDS = 60.</strong> Lastly, placement and orientation errors exhibiting obvious discrete chromatin interaction patterns were <strong>manually adjusted</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Synteny</strong> of the <em>D. kikuchii</em> <strong>genome</strong> with the <em>D. punctatus</em> <strong>genomes</strong> was analyzed using <strong>Minimap2</strong> and <strong>dotPlotly</strong> to identify chromosome structural changes among the two species.</p>

<p>Illumina reads were processed using <strong>Fastq-mcf</strong> (<strong>quality filtering</strong>; <a href="https://code.google.com/p/eautils/wiki/FastqMcf">https://code.google.com/p/eautils/wiki/FastqMcf</a>), <strong>PRINSEQ</strong> (<strong>duplication filtering</strong>; http:// prinseq.sourceforge.net/) and <strong>Musket</strong> (<strong>error correction</strong>; <a href="http://musket.sourceforge/">http://musket.sourceforge</a>. net/). <strong>Pacbio reads</strong> were processed using the <strong>SMRT Analysis pipeline</strong> (v.2.0.1; <a href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/SMRT-Analysis">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/SMRT-Analysis</a>).</p>
<p>Both genomes were assembled with <strong>SOAPdenovo</strong> with different k-mer sizes. For both genomes, <strong>k-mer = 79</strong> showed the best statistics. Gaps between contigs were completed using <strong>GapCloser</strong> . Additionally for P. axillaris, <strong>PacBio reads</strong> were integrated in <strong>four different steps</strong>: (1) <strong>Rescaffolding</strong> of the <strong>Illumina contigs</strong> using the <strong>PacBio reads</strong> and the <strong>AHA assembler</strong>; (2) <strong>Gap filling</strong> using <strong>PBJelly</strong>; (3) <strong>Rescaffolding</strong> using the Illumina <strong>pair data</strong> and <strong>SSPACE</strong>; (4) Last round of <strong>gap filling</strong> using <strong>PBJelly</strong> . </p>
<p><strong>Genome size estimation</strong> was performed through the k-mers abundance distribution (<strong>k-mer = 31</strong>). <strong>Heterozygosity</strong> was <strong>estimated</strong> mapping the Illumina reads to the assemblies using <strong>Bowtie2</strong>, calling SNPs using <strong>FreeBayes</strong> and  annotating the SNPs using <strong>SnpEff</strong> .</p>
<p>The genome structural annotation was performed using <strong>Maker-P</strong>: (1) <strong>SNAP</strong> and <strong>Augustus</strong> as ab initio gene predictors; (2) Exonerate as experimental based predictor with 454 and Illumina RNASeq reads and protein sequences from different protein datasets. RNAseq Illumina data was mapped using <strong>Tophat2</strong> . tRNAs were annotated using <strong>tRNAscan</strong> (<a href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/">http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/</a>).</p>
<p>The <strong>gene functional annotation</strong> was performed by <strong>sequence homology search</strong> with different protein datasets using <strong>BlastP</strong> and protein domains search using <strong>InterProScan</strong> . Functional annotations were integrated using <strong>AHRD</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD">https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD</a>). See Supplementary Note 1.</p>
<h2 id="Repetitive-elements-analysis"><a href="#Repetitive-elements-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Repetitive elements analysis"></a>Repetitive elements analysis</h2><p>Repeat annotation was performed using RepeatModeler (v1.0.8; <a href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html">http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html</a>), RepeatMasker (v4.0.5; <a href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">http://www.repeatmasker.org</a>) with the repeat database Repbase (release 20140131; <a href="http://www.girinst.org/repbase/">http://www.girinst.org/repbase/</a>) and Geneious (v7.1.4; <a href="http://www.geneious.com/">http://www.geneious.com</a>). Identification of PVCV-like and EPRV elements was performed using BlastN and TBlastN . The identified sequences were aligned with ClustalW (MEGA5 package;<a href="http://www.megasoftware.net/">http://www.megasoftware.net/</a>) and then manually curated. RepeatExplorer (<a href="http://www.repeatexplorer.org/">http://www.repeatexplorer.org/</a>) and other methods were used to extend the analysis to unassembled repeats. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed in root tips from young P. axillaris and P. inflata plants for 5S rDNA and three PVCV viral probes following the procedure described in Supplementary Note 2.</p>
<p>The detection of dTph1 loci in P. hybrida W138 was performed through a BLAST40 search of the P. axillaris and P. inflata dTph1 elements including the 500 bp of flanking sequence against the TFS W138 collection. Polymorphisms found in the genomic flanking regions were used to identify the species of origin. dTph1 elements were identified in a P. axillaris population using a modification of the methodology described in Supplementary Note 3.</p>
<p>##Whole-genome duplication, tandem duplications and gene family analysis</p>
<p>Whole-genome collinear analysis was performed using SynMap and microsynteny analysis were performed using GEvo in the comparative genomics platform, CoGe .See Supplementary Note 5.</p>
<p>The gene family analysis included Solanum lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana protein sets using BlastP (v2.2.27) on an all-versus-all comparison and grouping the genes into families with OrthoMCL, v2.0.8. See Supplementary Note 4.</p>
<h2 id="Gene-data-mining"><a href="#Gene-data-mining" class="headerlink" title="Gene data mining"></a>Gene data mining</h2><p>The specific identification of genes for P. axillaris and P. inflata genomes for colour and scent, root-specific pathways, self-incompatibility and circadian clock was performed through a BlastN/BlastP sequence homology search. Blast GUI, JBrowser (<a href="http://jbrowse.org/">http://jbrowse.org/</a>) and WebApollo (<a href="http://genomearchitect/">http://genomearchitect</a>. org/) were installed in a server to search and manually curate the gene structures of the identified genes.

<h2 id="组装策略及组装结果"><a href="#组装策略及组装结果" class="headerlink" title="组装策略及组装结果"></a><strong>组装策略及组装结果</strong></h2><ul>
<li><p>先用Pacbio的 long-read 数据构建contig， 使用<font color="blue"><strong>Celera Assembler</strong> PacBio corrected Reads 流程</font>组装。获得<font color="blue"><strong>3,074</strong>个contig(2.63G)，<strong>N50 4.159M</strong>b</font>。</p>
</li>
<li><p>接下来采用<font color="blue"><strong>Irys optical mapping</strong>数据构建<strong>scaffold</strong></font>，使用软件为<font color="blue"><strong>IrysView</strong></font>. 产生<font color="blue"><strong>842</strong>个scaffold，scaffold N50为<strong>13.4M</strong>b，contig N50为10.858M，最长scaffold为66.728Mb</font>。 利用<font color="red"><strong>radiation hybrid(RH) map比较</strong>发现</font>，<font color="blue">PacBio-Irys 联合</font>的方法已经<font color="blue">完整组装出<strong>20号染色体</strong></font>。</p>
</li>
<li><p>接下来用Hi-C数据，调用用<font color="red"><strong>Lachesis软件包</strong></font>，结合PacBio-Irys的结果，即整合的PacBio-Irys-PGA (PBIP)方法，获得较完美的组装结果。<font color="blue">Scaffold N50</font> 达到惊人的<font color="blue"><strong>87.347Mb</strong></font>(远超今年尖吻鲈，大猩猩N50 20Mb的高起点)，总共获得<font color="blue"><strong>31条</strong>scaffold</font>，(<font color="red">31,261条&lt;50kbp的**degenerate scaffold**不计入</font> )。</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="组装评估及比较分析"><a href="#组装评估及比较分析" class="headerlink" title="组装评估及比较分析"></a><strong>组装评估及比较分析</strong></h2><p>由于山羊之前已经产生过两个基因组版本<strong>CHIR_1.0、CHIR_2.0</strong>，可以用来做比较 分析，并且有RH mapping数据用来评估、校正ARS1的组装版本。 <strong>通过各种参数比较发现，ARS1均优于CHIR_2.0版本。</strong></p>
<p>1、通过比对发现，CHIR_2.0 比CHIR_1.0有更少的putative deletion(2,735 vs 1 0,256)和duplication(115 vs 290)。而2.0版本相较1.0有更多的inversion(215 v s 4)。通过比较，发现ARS1版本有大幅度地提升，较2.0版本少4倍的deletion， 少50倍inversion。</p>
<p>2、CHIR_2.0能填补CHIR_1.0 94.6%的gap，而剩下的那些gap通过分析ARS1得知，是CHIR_1.0的组装错误，而RH数据也支持了这一论断。 3、BUSCO是利用单拷贝ortholog来评估组装的可靠性，和CHIR_2.0相比，ARS1有更高的BUSCO score。</p>
<p>4、山羊52k SNP 芯片中，有1,723个SNP探针目前只能定位在CHIR_2.0组装版本 中的unplaced contigs上。而ARS1版本能把其中的90%(1,552/1,723)以上的S NP探针定位在染色体上。另外发现有26个low call-rate 的SNPmarker在ARS1组装版本上定位比较模棱两可。这也就解释了为什么这些maker在芯片上有较差的call -rate. </p>
<p>5、通过比较发现，CHIR_2.0版本中的3,495个内含子或外显子有gap的基因，在ARS1中都得到补全。同时也确认1,926个预测的外显子在CHIR_1.0或者2.0中有gap， 但在ARS1中得到修复。 </p>
<p>6、由于免疫基因区高度多态性和重复性，用二代测序数据很难组装起来，但是通过 分析发现，ARS1版本就很好地把LRC和NKC基因(免疫功能相关基因)定位在一个独立的常染色体scaffold上。 </p>
<p>7、通过和一代、二代组装策略相比，ARS1版本在重复序列的组装上获得了极大进步。对某些异染色体或异染色质的区域也获得了较好的组装覆盖。比如，在6条常 染色体上组装出&gt;5kbp的端粒序列。通过分析发现， 15条染色体scaffold，在着丝粒区域组装出大于2kbp长度的重复区，而其中的7条，更是装出来8kbp以上的重复区。更令人惊讶的是，19号和23号染色体都组装出高度重复的着丝粒和端粒区域， 贯通了有结构性异染色质区的染色体。 </p>
<p>8、在ARS1版本中鉴定出大于12kbp的重复模式序列多达105条。对于重复序列家 族的鉴定，在ARS1中获得的接近全长的BovB LINE 序列比CHIR_2.0多60%以上。 在CHIR_2.0版本里，被ARS1成功补全的gap中的43.6%与BovB重复序列一致(长 度大于3.5kbp)，即意味着二代测序的gap区大多都是重复序列，用三代就能较容易测通。 </p>
<p>9、关于性染色体的分析。通过比对发现，两个不同的scaffold比对到X染色体的不同但连续的区域，占预期X染色体大小(150Mb)的86%左右。通过和自己的、跨物种牛的Y染色体比对，最终确定出10Mb区域的序列，占Y染色体预估大小的50% 左右。通过比对牛和羊的Y染色体上的基因，发现在目前的scaffold中能找到16%， 而在先前过滤掉的degenerate contig中能找到84%的基因。考虑到Y染色体的异染 色质属性及X,Y染色体的拟常染色区域经常发现交换，实在太过复杂，超出目前的组装和认知水平，表示实在无能为力。</p>
<p>10、利用之前RH mapping data，对组装的大部分环节进行了校正及评估。比如多次辅助解决scaffold conflict的问题。</p>
<h2 id="基因组注释"><a href="#基因组注释" class="headerlink" title="基因组注释"></a><strong>基因组注释</strong></h2><p>多种方法结合注释基因集。<br>1.<strong>RNA-seq的方法:</strong> 6个组织(大多和脑组织相关)RNA-seq测序、13个SRA下载 数据，利用stringtie、cufflinks和Trinity(基于无参组装)。最后用PASA软件整合在一起;</p>
<p>2.<strong>用exonerate和tblastn 软件</strong>比对到几个近缘物种的Ensembl基因集上，获得同 源预测基因集;</p>
<p>3.<strong>用Braker1做Ab initio 预测</strong>;</p>
<p>4.<strong>CHIR_1.0 版本的注释基因集</strong>; 最后用<strong>EVM+PASA</strong>把以上4种数据整合成一个最终的基因集(设置的权重为RNAseq &gt; cDNA/protein &gt; ab initio gene predictions)。</p>
<h2 id="启示录"><a href="#启示录" class="headerlink" title="启示录"></a><strong>启示录</strong></h2><p>1、Pacbio RSII是一个较为理想组装平台，产生平均14Kbp左右的读长，最高到60 Kbp，可以组装出较为理想的基因组版本。由于三代的长读长优势，同时可以较好地组装出基因组中大部分高度重复区(主要集中在着丝粒和端粒区域);</p>
<p>2、BioNano 的Irys optical mapping 是一种非常有效的，成本比较适中的构建scaffold的平台。和Hi-C比优势在于定位错误较少，缺点是对N50的提高并不是特别显著，一般在2倍左右。如果正反链的Nt.BsqI酶切位点离得比较近，常常导致双链 断裂，限制了Optical Map scaffold的大小。所以，BioNano对较长的scaffold效果比较好。由于Optical map和pacbio产生的错误特征并不一样，两者结合，可以 相互校正，获得较好的组装指标;</p>
<p>3、Hi-C是目前非常火爆的一个技术，在多个领域都有很好的应用。在组装方面， 它能获得染色体级别的scaffold，但是也容易获得较高的contig定向错误。这也是 为什么文章中，先用optical mapping，后用Hi-C做scaffolding的重要原因之一。 作者建议在以后的实验中，可以选择较短的识别位点的限制内切酶(或者DNase Hi -C)来提高Hi-C交联的密度，降低定向错误。</p>
<p>4、利用同样的方法和平台，做类似的基因组项目，用Pacbio平台和scaffolding平 台，目前大约花费在$100,000上下,而一般的短reads平台测序加scaffolding 平台，只需要其三分之一的价格。但是用Pacbio平台却获得了高质量的、连续性好的基因组序列。目前Pacbio 新一代的sequel平台已经推出，单个cell的产量比RSII提 高7倍以上，测序成本将会得到大幅度降低，相信会成为未来基因组研究的主流工具之一。</p>
<p>5、本文的研究策略确实会启迪后来的研究者，为de novo组装树立新标杆。Pacbio 测序技术联合多种scaffolding 平台(比如BioNano、Hi-C，mating-pairedlibr ary，10X genomics)的使用， 会引领de novo 组装进入 near finished genome 或者finished genome的新时代。</p>
<p>6、但是，尽管做了很多努力，ARS1仍然是一个单体型混合型的组装版本。在未来，可以利用single molecule和Hi-C技术获得单体型分期(haplotype phasing) 的参考基因组。对于组成型异染色质区，尤其是着丝粒和端粒部分，仍然是组装的盲区，即使在人的基因组中这些区域也没有被完整组装出来。</p>

<p>Soybean is one of the most important vegetable oil and protein feed crops. To capture the entire genomic diversity, it is needed to construct a complete high-quality pan-genome from diverse soybean accessions. In this study, we performed individual de novo genome assemblies for <strong>26 representative soybeans</strong> that were selected from <strong>2,898 deeply sequenced accessions</strong>. Using these assembled genomes together with <strong>three previously reported genomes</strong>, we constructed a <strong>graph-based genome</strong> and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified <strong>numerous genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto a single reference genome</strong>. The <strong>structural variations</strong> from the 2,898 accessions that were <strong>genotyped</strong> based on the graph-based genome and the <strong>RNA-seq data</strong> from the representative 26 accessions helped to <strong>link genetic variations to candidate genes</strong> that are responsible for important traits. This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics studies in soybean.</p>

<p>被子植物（Angiosperms or flowering plants）是地球上分布范围最广、多样化最高、适应性最强的陆生植物类群，极大地影响了其他生物类群的演化进程，然而，由于被子植物在早期经历了快速的辐射进化，其内部演化关系迟迟未被解决，这一问题也被称为达尔文的“恼人之谜”。经过前人长时期的努力，目前被子植物被划分为：无油樟目、睡莲目、木兰藤目和核心被子植物（Mesangiospermae）。无油樟目、睡莲目、木兰藤目共同被称为ANA grade，是被子植物的基部类群，系统发育关系相对稳定，而核心被子植物包含了~99.95%的被子植物，又可被划分为5大类群：双子叶、单子叶、木兰类、金鱼藻目和金粟兰目，它们之间的演化关系一直存在争议。近年来，随着各类群代表物种全基因组测序相继完成，其各自的进化历程均有了坚实而可靠的证据，刘建全团队在2020年首次报道了金鱼藻和芡实的基因组，证明了核心被子植物内部存在广泛的不完全谱系分选和杂交事件是导致树形冲突的主要原因。但是金粟兰目一直未有基因组报道，其演化历程以及整个核心被子植物的演化过程还有待深入分析。为此该团队再次利用Nanopore、Illumina和Hi-C技术，构建了第一个金粟兰目植物（四川金粟兰，<em>Chloranthus sessilifolius</em>）的高质量染色体级别基因组，Contig N50高达53.74 Mb（图1），使用多种分析方法对上述问题进行了深入的阐述。</p>
<p>通过使用多种系统发育基因组学分析，包括单拷贝基因、低拷贝基因和共线性基因数据集，进行了串联树和溯祖树的构建，同时评估了长枝吸引、物种选择和同源聚类方法等的影响，使用多套数据集合和多种分析方法，获得了高可信度的拓扑结构，即金粟兰目和木兰类具有最近的亲缘关系，且他们一起与金鱼藻目+双子叶植物构成姊妹关系，而单子叶植物是其它所有核心被子植物的姊妹枝（图2）。</p>
<p>同时，作者也发现了大量的基因树或叶绿体树与物种树不一致的情况，因此着重评估了不完全谱系分选（ILS）和杂交事件对此冲突的贡献。通过PhyloNetworks分析鉴定到了三次可能的杂交事件，可以解析部分的树形冲突。然而值得注意的是五大类群之间的分化时间仅有23个百万年（158~135 Mya），如此短的分化时间，ILS可能发挥了更为主要的作用。使用theta参数对每个内部分支发生ILS的概率进行评估发现，除了木兰类和金粟兰目的姊妹关系较为稳定外，其他类群间都具有较高的theta值，而金鱼藻目+双子叶的祖先分枝具有较高的tehta值，均表明了ILS在核心被子植物内部的演化中发挥了重要作用（图3 a和b）。基于Phyabse和DendroPy进行树形模拟表明，当存在ILS时模拟的树形和真实树形具有高度一致性（R2＞0.99），而不存在ILS的模拟树形与真实树形则具有较低的相关性，进一步表明了ILS在核心被子植物的快速辐射中发挥了重要作用（图3 c-f）。进一步对树形异质性进行区分表明，ILS可基本解释金鱼藻目+双子叶的祖先枝上的树形冲突，也就是金鱼藻目+双子叶、木兰类+金粟兰和单子叶之间的冲突，而其他核心被子植物类群间的冲突还有其他因素（例如杂交）的参与。</p>
<p>此外，本研究还鉴定了四川金粟兰独有的一次WGD事件，同时5大核心被子植物分枝的加倍事件都不共享；鉴定了花发育相关的基因家族，解析了其特有花器官的可能形成原因；鉴定了萜类合成和木质部形成相关的基因家族，为今后研究其简单木质部形成和萜类物种合成通路演化提供了基础。</p>
<p>综上所述，该研究报道了高质量的四川金粟兰基因组，填补了核心被子植物金粟兰目的基因组信息，并通过多种分析策略和方法，深入的揭示了核心被子植物间的复杂演化历程，该成果对于早期被子植物的起源、辐射进化以及适应性演化提供数据支撑和理论基础。</p>

<p>油茶是我国传统木本油料树种，具有2300余年栽培食用历史。自上世纪起，经过四代科技工作者艰苦努力，我国油茶主栽良种衍生出数百个品种。但受制于<font color="blue">多倍性、长时效</font>特性，油茶育种工作效率不高。</p>
<p>2022年1月10日，中国林业科学研究院亚热带林业研究所（亚林所）研究员<strong>姚小华团队</strong>和<strong>殷恒福团队</strong>在<strong>《基因组生物学》（Genome Biology）</strong>发表最新论文。</p>
<p>该研究成功组装全球首个染色体级别高质量油茶基因组，揭示<font color="red">油茶物种<strong>进化历史</strong>及其<strong>种子含高油脂</strong>、<strong>高不饱和脂肪酸</strong>的<strong>驯化机制</strong></font>，建立了油脂性状早期选择技术体系，为加快良种选育效率、保障我国粮油安全奠定了基础。</p>
<h2 id="抱子怀胎的油茶良种育种缓慢"><a href="#抱子怀胎的油茶良种育种缓慢" class="headerlink" title="抱子怀胎的油茶良种育种缓慢"></a>抱子怀胎的油茶良种育种缓慢</h2><p>良种是农业生产的“芯片”。作为我国四大油料作物之一，油茶是农民增收、粮油安全、生态建设的“重要法宝”。我国油茶育种历经了选择育种和定向杂交育种阶段，主栽良种由家系品种、农家品种走向无性系良种，衍生出数百个品种，构成了我国油茶产业的发展基础。</p>
<p>但由于油茶结实之前要经历漫长的童期，而且从<font color="blue">开花到果实成熟需要整整1年时间</font>，俗称‘抱子怀胎’，导致油茶育种年限长，新品种选育缓慢，良种选育速度无法满足产业发展的需求，已成为阻碍油茶产业发展的重要因素。</p>
<p>我国长期面临食用油供需压力，对外依存度高达60%。油茶能够利用我国亚热带区域的宜林山地种植，不与粮争地，是保障我国粮油安全、实现乡村振兴的重要抓手。</p>
<p>油茶泛指山茶科山茶属植物中油脂含量高，具有一定栽培面积的，有经济栽培价值的物种的总称，是我国主推的重要木本油料树种。我国现有油茶种植面积7000万亩，以普通油茶（Camellia oleifera）为主，年总产值1200亿元左右。</p>
<p>油茶籽油中不饱和脂肪酸达90%以上，其中以单不饱和脂肪酸油酸为主，富含角鲨烯、维生素E、甾醇、多酚等功能成分，具有极高的保健价值，被誉为“液体黄金”。</p>
<p>然而研究发现, 油茶基因组具有<font color="red"><strong>杂合率高、重复序列占比大</strong>的特点，其杂合率达到了<strong>2.52%</strong></font>，远高于大部分已测序的物种，这为基因组组装带来了巨大挑战。</p>
<h2 id="染色体级别组装"><a href="#染色体级别组装" class="headerlink" title="染色体级别组装"></a>染色体级别组装</h2><p>经过四年多的努力，该团队获得大小为<font color="red">2.95 GB，Contig N50为<strong>1.002 MB</strong></font>的二倍体油茶（CON）的基因组图谱，并将基因组<font color="red">锚定到15条染色体</font>，锚定率达到<font color="red">91.33%</font>，获得了质量优良的油茶基因组图谱。</p>

<p>油茶物种起源与分布主要集中在我国南方亚热带地区。通过对油茶基因组的比较分析，发现油茶基因组共发生<font color="red"><strong>两次全基因组复制</strong>事件</font>：第一次为古老的<font color="red">γ复制</font>，第二次发生在<font color="red"><strong>山茶属与猕猴桃属</strong>分化前不久</font>。</p>
<p>而山茶属形成之后并没有发生特殊的全基因组复制事件。通过山茶—猕猴桃、山茶—柿、柿—猕猴桃<font color="red"><strong>属间同源突变率的比较</strong></font>印证这一观点。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/03/14/2022-03-14-HiFi-6-HiC-assembly/3.png" alt="油茶基因组重复序列分析"></p>
<p>山茶属包括200多个物种，包括以<strong>普通油茶</strong>为代表的油茶组、以<strong>茶</strong>为代表的茶组和以<strong>山茶花</strong>为代表的山茶组等。系统发育和分子钟标定分析发现，<strong>油茶和茶的分化</strong>发生在大约17.3百万年前。</p>
<p>在长期栽培驯化中，区别于以叶用为目的的茶和以观赏为目的的山茶，油茶在人工选择作用下进化成以种子油脂为主要栽培目的的木本油料树种，使得油茶成为研究植物种子<font color="red"><strong>油脂性状驯化</strong></font>的绝佳材料。</p>
<p>为进一步揭示油茶油脂性状驯化的分子机制，该团队利用全国分布区内的<font color="red">221个代表品种</font>开展<font color="red"><strong>群体转录组测序和关联分析</strong></font>。结果发现在长期<strong>驯化</strong>过程中，油茶果实逐渐<strong>增大</strong>，种仁油脂含量显著<strong>提高</strong>，油脂品质不断<strong>优化</strong>，形成了目前主栽的果大、含油率高、油脂品质优良的栽培类型。</p>
<p>进一步分析发现驯化过程中，油茶基因组中<font color="red"><strong>油脂代谢通路</strong>中的多个<strong>基因</strong>受到了<strong>显著的人工选择</strong></font>。此外，<font color="red">胁迫应答、激素生物合成</font>等通路也受到显著选择。</p>
<p>为了挖掘高度可信的油脂代谢关键基因，联合采用<font color="red"><strong>基因组遗传变异、基因表达水平和表型性状变异关联分析</strong></font>。令人惊讶的是，在<font color="red">筛选出的<strong>21个候选</strong>基因</font>中，有<font color="red"><strong>14个</strong></font>属于油脂合成和分解代谢通路基因。</p>

<p>其中，油脂代谢通路中的8个基因和植物激素相关转录因子IAA26在长期<strong>栽培驯化</strong>过程中<strong>形成</strong><font color="red"><strong>显著</strong>的<strong>单核苷酸多态性</strong>和<strong>表达水平差异</strong></font>。“这8个基因既包括<font color="red">油脂合成</font>基因，也有<font color="red">油脂分解代谢</font>基因，这表明油茶<font color="red"><strong>油脂性状</strong></font>是由参与合成和分解的<font color="red"><strong>两类基因协同调控</strong></font>的结果。</p>

Ten 20 kb de novo SMRTbell libraries were constructed according to the standard manufacturer’s protocol and used for <font color="red">SMRT PacBio</font> genome sequencing. A total of 27,876,348 reads (total size of <strong>320 G</strong>) were generated and used for initial assembly by the <font color="red"><strong>Falcon</strong></font> (v0.3.0) pipeline. The <font color="red"><strong>HaploMerger2</strong></font> (v20180603) program (default parameters) was used to <strong>reduce the redundancy</strong>, and <font color="red"><strong>Arrow program</strong></font> with default parameters was used to <strong>correct</strong> the sequencing <strong>errors</strong>. Further, a total of <font color="red">210 G</font> clean data generated by the <strong>Illumina</strong> Nova- Seq6000 platform was used to <font color="red">correct</font> the PacBio reads.</p>
<p>To circumvent the high heterozygosity of the CON genome, a <font color="red"><strong>hybrid assembly of strategy</strong></font> was used to construct the high-quality reference genome. The details of the <font color="red"><strong>BioNano, 10X Genomics, and Hi-C</strong></font> sequencing procedures were described in the Additional File 3: Method S1; and the hybrid assembly approach was described in <strong>Additional File 2</strong>: Fig. S3. Finally, to construct a chromosome-scale reference genome, the Hi-C chromosomal interaction was created using HiC-pro [38] software (v2.5.0) (<strong>Additional File 2</strong>: Fig. S4). </p>
<p>The <font color="red">repetitive elements</font> in the CON genome, including tandem repeats and interspersed repeats, were identified. Tandem repeats were discovered by <font color="red"><strong>Tandem Repeats Finder</strong></font> v4.07b. Interspersed repeats in the genome were identified using an integration of <strong>independent homology searching and de novo predictions</strong> (See details in Additional File 3: Method S2). Non-coding RNA genes (ncRNA) were annotated in this study (see details in Additional File 3: Method S2) and the results were shown in Additional File 1: Table S4.</p>
<p>We <font color="red">annotated</font> the assembled genome through combining three different approaches: <font color="red"><strong>ab initio prediction, homology-based prediction,</strong> and <strong>transcriptome alignment</strong></font>. To ob- tain the transcriptome data, the total RNA of seven different tissues from CON was se- quenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. The transcripts homolog prediction was performed initially by MAKER (v2.31.10); Augustus (v3.3.1) and SNAP (v2006-07-28) were used for de novo prediction. Finally, both homolog and de novo prediction results were integrated using MAKER and resulted in the final gene models (Additional File 1: Table S5; see details in Additional File 3: Method S2)</p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Functional annotation</strong></font> was achieved by comparing predicted proteins against public databases, including NCBI non-redundant protein sequences database (Nr), SwissProt (201709) [39], eggNOG [39], KEGG (v84) [40], Interpro (v5.16-55.0) [41], and GO [42] using Blast (v2.2.3) [43].</p>

<p><strong>菊花</strong>(<em>Chrysanthemum ×morifolium</em> Ramat.)是世界著名的观赏植物，具有千姿百态的花型。实际菊花的花是指由<font color="red"><strong>外围的舌状花</strong></font>和<font color="red"><strong>盘心的管状花</strong></font>共同构成的<font color="red"><strong>头状花序</strong></font>。其花型由头状花序上舌状花和管状花的形态和相对数量决定。解析同一头状花序上舌状花和管状花分化的分子调控机制不仅可以为阐明菊花复杂的头状花序形态奠定基础，也将为菊科植物头状花序发育提供新见解。但目前关于菊花花型的研究受到其复杂遗传背景的限制，导致无法充分利用菊花丰富的基因资源进行花型定向育种。因此，获得高质量的菊花及其近缘种的基因组信息并在此基础上<font color="red">研究<strong>头状花序发育</strong>的<strong>分子调控机制</strong></font>显得尤为必要。</p>
<p>近日，<em><strong>Horticulture Research</strong></em>在线发表了<strong>北京林业大学戴思兰团队</strong>题为<em><strong>The Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium genome and the molecular mechanism underlying diverse capitulum types</strong></em> 的研究论文。该论文完成<font color="red"><strong>菊花近缘野生种</strong>之一<strong>甘菊</strong></font>(C. lavandulifolium)的全基因测序工作，获得了染色体水平上的高质量甘菊参考基因组，结合<font color="red"><strong>3种不同类型菊科植物头状花序</strong>的<strong>转录组数据</strong></font>初步解析了头状花序发育的<strong>分子调控机制</strong>，为实现人工调控菊花花型奠定了坚实的分子理论基础。</p>
<p>甘菊为菊属植物中的<strong>二倍体物种</strong>，采用<strong>Illumina + Pacbio + Hi-C</strong>测序技术对其进行全基因测序，获得了2.60 Gb的染色体水平的参考基因组。其中<font color="red">94.46%的序列锚定到<strong>9条染色体</strong>上</font>。甘菊基因组中重复序列占基因组的67.69%，<em>Cypsy</em>和<em>Copia</em>的占比分别为37.92%和29.06%，插入时间在1.25百万年前。<font color="red"><strong>比较基因组分析</strong></font>结果表明，甘菊经历了<font color="red"><strong>两次全基因组复制(WGD)事件</strong></font>，其中<font color="red"><strong>最近一次</strong>是所有<strong>菊科植物共有</strong></font>，而<font color="red"><strong>较早一次</strong>是核心双子叶植物共有的<strong>γ事件</strong></font>，**甘菊自身没有发生WGD，其基因组演化的动力来源主要是<font color="red">串联重复事件</font>**。</p>

<p>粉葛基因组及多组学分析为<font color="red">葛根素</font>等功效成分的生物合成研究提供新见解</p>
<p>广西壮族自治区农业科学院经济作物研究所严华兵团队。该研究利用<strong>PacBio</strong>、<strong>Illumina</strong>测序以及<strong>Hi-C</strong>技术测序组装，<strong>获得了首个<font color="red">豆科葛属药食同源植物粉葛</font>染色体级别的基因组</strong>，标志着粉葛研究迈入基因组时代，开启了<font color="blue">葛属<strong>进化</strong>、野葛<strong>驯化</strong>、粉葛<strong>品种改良</strong></font>之旅，助力广西特色优势粉葛产业高质量发展。</p>
<p>鉴于粉葛<font color="blue">杂合度较高</font>，研究者选用了PacBio和Hi-C测序，构建的粉葛基因组大小为<strong>1.38Gb</strong>，<font color="blue">Contig N50=598kb</font>，并将<font color="blue">99.3%的序列<strong>锚定</strong>到11条染色体上</font>，BUSCO评估<font color="blue">92.9%</font>。通过注释，共获得45270个蛋白编码基因，其中<font color="blue"><strong>94.4%的基因</strong>可以得到<strong>功能注释</strong></font>，基因组中<font color="blue">重复序列</font>占比为62.7%。将粉葛<font color="red">与<strong>16个近缘物种</strong>(包含5个豆科植物)进行<strong>比较基因组</strong>分析</font>，结果表明6个豆科植物共有基因家族为11204个，粉葛基因组中<font color="blue"><strong>显著扩张的4743个基因家族</strong>主要富集在与<strong>类黄酮、生物碱、甾醇和萜类</strong>等生物合成相关的通路</font>；粉葛<font color="red"><strong>特有</strong>基因家族</font>为2373个，主要<font color="blue">富集在与<strong>萜类</strong>生物合成相关的通路</font>；粉葛基因组中受到<font color="blue"><strong>显著正选择</strong>的基因</font>共有34个，富集在<font color="blue"><strong>昼夜节律、同源重组、淀粉代谢和蔗糖代谢</strong></font>等途径。</p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>系统进化分析</strong></font>表明，粉葛<strong>与大豆亲缘关系最近</strong>，两者在20.1个百万年前产生分化。通过<font color="red"><strong>Ks</strong>和<strong>4DTV分析</strong></font>，<strong>粉葛共经历两次WGD事件</strong>，一次WGD事件是<font color="blue">大豆与粉葛<strong>共有</strong></font>，发生在44.5个百万年前；另一次WGD事件是在粉葛与大豆分化后，<font color="blue">粉葛<strong>独自</strong>经历</font>，发生时间大致在4.8个百万年前。</p>
<p>通过对高葛根素ZG-19和低葛根素ZG-39进行<font color="red"><strong>转录组</strong>和<strong>代谢组</strong>分析</font>，研究者检测到了614种225种差异代谢物(DMs)，1814个差异表达基因(DEG)，DMs和DEG的丰富功能类别<strong>重叠</strong>，这说明它们都是与<font color="blue">类黄酮、异黄酮和ABC转运相关的基因或代谢物</font>。进一步分析代谢物与基因表达的相关系数，结果表明代谢物和基因对在样本中高度相关，60%的显著相关性涉及上调的代谢物和下调或不变的基因，在15%的显著相关性中，代谢物和基因表达的变化方向相同。此外，研究者在异黄酮生物合成途径中发现了大量的DMs和DEG。<strong>这充分解析了粉葛中异黄酮的生物合成途径。</strong></p>
<p>通过<font color="red"><strong>同源基因搜索</strong></font>，研究者发现<font color="blue">编码<strong>葛根素合成途径</strong>中关键酶的9个基因家族</font>在粉葛中都有所<font color="blue">扩张</font>；通过分析糖基转移酶家族中催化糖基化修饰的基因，共鉴定出104个GT基因，有13个基因与8-C-葡萄糖基转移酶(8-C-GT)同源，其中6个与先前研究的催化大豆苷元C-糖基化为葛根素的PIUGT43基因同源；编码大豆异黄酮合酶(IFS)的基因(CHR11G3854.1)催化着葛根素合成的中间代谢物大豆苷元的合成，被鉴定为与葛根素的合成途径高度相关。总之，上述分析<strong>初步解析了粉葛中葛根素的生物合成途径。</strong></p>
<p><strong>综上，该研究通过构建高质量的粉葛基因组解析了粉葛基因组的<font color="red">进化特征</font>；通过多组学分析深入解析了粉葛中<font color="red">重要次生代谢物异黄酮、葛根素等生物合成途径</font>，从而为粉葛的资源利用、遗传育种等研究提供了新见解。</strong></p>

<p>Chromosome-scale and haplotype-resolved genome assembly of a tetraploid potato cultivar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>##<strong>Genome size estimation.</strong> </p>
<p>After <strong>trimming</strong> off 10× genomics <font color="blue"><strong>barcodes and hexamers</strong></font> from the 370.3-Gb reads combined from the 10× single-cell CNV libraries and single-molecule libraries, <em>k</em>-mer counting (<em>k</em> = 21) was performed with <font color="red"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></font> (v.2.2.10). The <em>k</em>-mer histogram was provided to <font color="red"><strong>findGSE</strong></font> (v.1.0)39 to estimate the haploid/tetraploid genome size of ‘Otava’ under the <font color="blue">heterozygous mode</font> (with ‘exp_hom = 200’; Extended Data Fig. 1).</p>
<p>##<strong>Initial tetraploid genome assembly, polishing and purging.</strong> </p>
<p>The initial assembly of the tetraploid genome was performed using <font color="red"><strong>hifiasm (v.0.7)</strong></font> with <strong>default settings</strong> with the 102 Gb raw PacBio HiFi reads of ‘Otava’, where the output consisting of <font color="red"><strong>unitigs</strong> (locally haplotype-resolved contigs)</font> was selected for <strong>further processing</strong>. </p>
<p>Then the <font color="blue">short reads</font> from the two 10× single-cell CNV libraries were <font color="blue"><strong>aligned</strong> to the assembly</font> using <font color="red"><strong>bowtie2 (v.2.2.8)</strong></font>. These <font color="blue">alignments were used to <strong>polish</strong> the <strong>assembly</strong></font> with <font color="red"><strong>pilon (v.1.22)</strong></font> with <font color="green"><strong>options</strong> of <strong>–fixbases –changes –diploid –mindepth 0.8</strong></font>. </p>
<p>Further, <font color="blue"><strong>short</strong> reads</font> of the two 10× single-cell CNV libraries, additional 10× single-molecule libraries <strong>and</strong> PacBio <font color="blue"><strong>HiFi</strong> reads</font> were <font color="blue"><strong>all aligned</strong> to the <strong>polished assembly</strong></font> (using <font color="red"><strong>bowtie2</strong></font> and <font color="red"><strong>minimap2</strong></font> (v.2.17-r491) respectively). Among <font color="blue">17,153 raw contigs, <strong>9,041 contigs</strong></font> which were <font color="blue">longer than <strong>50 kb</strong></font> and with an <font color="blue">average sequencing depth over <strong>80×</strong> were <strong>kept</strong></font>. </p>
<p><font color="blue">HiFi reads were <strong>re-aligned</strong> to the purged assembly and contigs covered less than 3× were <strong>removed</strong></font>. </p>
<p>The HiFi reads-based <font color="red"><strong>purging process</strong></font> was repeated for <font color="blue"><strong>five rounds</strong></font> to get an initial assembly of <font color="blue">6,366 contigs</font> for subsequent analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p>
<p>##<strong>Haplotype-specific PacBio HiFi read separation and haplotype assembly.</strong></p>
<p>HiFi reads were <font color="blue">classified into 48 groups</font> on the basis of alignments to the 50-kb coverage markers using customized code. Specifically, to assign a read to a marker, at least 500 bp of the read had to be aligned to the marker (reads aligning two neighboring markers were assigned to the marker with a larger overlapping size). Reads overlapping non-haplotig marker were randomly assigned to one of the marker-associated groups.</p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Each set</strong> of HiFi reads</font> was independently assembled using <font color="red"><strong>hifiasm</strong></font> (v.0.7) with default settings. The resulting contigs were first polished with <font color="red">short reads using <strong>pilon</strong></font> with <font color="green"><strong>–fix bases –changes –diploid –mindepth 0.8</strong></font> and then with <font color="red">HiFi reads using <strong>racon</strong></font> (v.1.4.10)46 with<font color="green"> <strong>-u –no-trimming</strong></font>.</p>
<p>##<strong>Evaluation of haplotyping accuracy.</strong> </p>
<p>For <font color="blue">each haplotype assembly</font> and the sequencing data of the parental genomes, <em>k</em>-mers (<em>k</em> = 21) were counted using <font color="red"><strong>KMC</strong></font>. Specifically, <em>k</em>-mers found in ‘Hera’ but not in ‘Stieglitz’ (with a coverage<br>of 6–12), as well as <em>k</em>-mers found in ‘Stieglitz’ but not in ‘Hera’ (with a coverage of 5–11) were selected using kmc_tools simple. For each haplotype, the sets of assembled <em>k</em>-mers were intersected with the two sets of parental-specific <em>k</em>-mers (using kmc_tools simple with subfunction intersect), which revealed <strong><em>k</em>-mers common with either of the parental genomes</strong>. </p>
<p>As a haplotype can only be inherited from one of the parents, it is expected to find parental-specific *k-*mers only of one parent. The overall haplotyping precision was determined as the total number of correctly phased <em>k</em>-mers divided by the total number of <em>k</em>-mers investigated in the <font color="red"><strong>48 haplotype assemblies</strong></font>. Note, this was done <font color="rblueed">before and after contig <strong>polishing</strong></font>, where we observed the same haplotyping accuracy.</p>
<p>##<strong>Haplotype-specific contig scaffolding using group-specific Hi-C reads.</strong> </p>
<p><font color="blue">Each haplotype-specific contig-level assembly</font> was indexed with <font color="red"><strong>bwa index</strong></font> (with -a bwtsw) (v.0.7.15-r1140) and <font color="red"><strong>samtools faidx</strong></font>. The haplotype-specific Hi-C read pairs were aligned using <font color="red"><strong>bwa aln</strong> and <strong>bwa sampe</strong></font>. Aligned reads (in pairs) were <strong>converted into BAM</strong> files using samtools view with options of <font color="green">-b -F12</font>. The BAM files were filtered with <font color="red"><strong>filterBAM_forHiC.pl</strong></font> (from ALLHiC package, v.0.9.13) to <font color="blue"><strong>remove nonuniquely mapped reads</strong></font>. Then BAM files were converted to bed files using <font color="red"><strong>bamToBed</strong></font> (from bedtools package) and <font color="blue"><strong>sorted</strong> by read name</font>. The <strong>bed files</strong> were provided to <font color="red"><em><strong>SALSA2</strong></em></font> (run with <font color="green">-s 100000000 -m yes -i 10 -e DNASE</font>). Potential chimeric contigs were broken at the chimeric sites given by SALSA2 output file of input_breaks, leading to a <font color="blue"><strong>new set</strong> of contigs for each of the 48 original groups</font>.</p>
<p>For <font color="blue">each new group of contigs</font>, the above process of <font color="red"><strong>contig indexing, Hi-C read alignment</strong> and <strong>BAM filtering</strong></font> was repeated. Then, for each haplotype, <font color="red"><strong>ALLHiC_ partition</strong></font> was run with <font color="green">-e GATC -k 1 -m 25</font>; <font color="red"><strong>allhic extract</strong></font> was run with <font color="green">–RE GATC</font>; allhic optimize and <font color="red"><strong>ALLHiC_build</strong></font> were run with <font color="green">default settings</font>; the chromosome contact map was visualized with <font color="red"><strong>ALLHiC_plot</strong></font> at <font color="green">1-Mb</font> resolution, where obvious mis-placement/orientation of large contigs were visually identified and manually corrected (Extended Data Fig. 3).</p>

<p><strong>Genome assembly and scaffolding</strong></p>
<p>The genome assembly workflow began with <em>de novo</em> assembly of contigs from the PacBio long reads using 2 tools, <font color="red"><strong>Canu</strong></font> (version 1.5) and <font color="red"><strong>Falcon</strong></font> (version 0.5). For each assembler the most important assembly parameters were systematically varied (Supplementary Methods), as defined by the tool developers, and by consideration of assembly theory (e.g., overlap length, overlap identity for overlap layout consensus assembly). <font color="blue"><strong>Optimal settings</strong> were <strong>selected</strong></font> by <strong>comparison of assembly statistics</strong> (total size assembled and contig N50) and by <strong>alignment of Illumina PE</strong> data to the assembly with <font color="red"><strong>bowtie2</strong></font> (using the “very fast” pre-set). For <font color="blue">all PacBio assemblies</font> the consensus step was performed by running <font color="red"><strong>Quiver纠错</strong></font> (Genomic Consensus version 2.3.3) (with default parameters) on <font color="blue">raw PacBio contigs</font> and using the full 63× of PacBio data.</p>
<p>Assembled contigs were further joined into scaffolds using a combination of <strong>BioNano optical mapping</strong> data, <strong>Hi-C</strong> chromatin conformation capture data, and <strong>genetic maps.</strong> The best <font color="blue">assemblies from Canu and Falcon</font> were <font color="blue">independently combined with</font> BioNano optical mapping data using the <font color="red">IrysView</font> software to develop the Canu + BioNano (CB) and Falcon + BioNano (FB) assemblies, respectively. The BioNano scaffolding process identified conflicts between the assembled contigs and the optical map, indicating some degree of misassembly in both Canu and Falcon results.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly polishing</strong></p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Pilon</strong></font> (version1.21) [31] was <font color="blue">run iteratively</font> on the assembly, with <font color="blue">Illumina sequence realigned to the polished assembly</font> at each iteration and then <font color="blue">alignments passed to Pilon to call the next consensus</font>. Alignments for Pilon were produced using <font color="red"><strong>BWA mem</strong></font> (v0.7.17) with default settings. <em>k</em>-mer spectrum comparisons were made using the <em>k</em>-mer analysis toolkit (<font color="red"><strong>KAT</strong></font>) (version 2.3.4) [13] (KAT comp) at a <em>k</em>-mer size of 32, and <font color="blue">the metric used to assess each iteration was the number of <strong>k-mers shared between</strong> the <strong>assembly</strong> and the <strong>Illumina</strong> reads</font>. </p>
<p>In a second consensus phase, <font color="blue">RNA-Seq</font> reads were aligned as single end (SE), to the genome using <font color="red"><strong>Hisat</strong></font> (version 2.1.0)  with default parameters. This time the effectiveness of consensus calling was <font color="blue">assessed by analysis of <strong>full-length alignments</strong> of assembled RNA-Seq transcripts</font>. All transcripts designated as “complete” by Evigene  were aligned to the genome with BLAT  (version 3.4, with [34] minimum match identity 90%). Alignments were filtered to <strong>retain only full-length alignments</strong> (i.e., from query start to query end). </p>
<p>Finally, the number of gaps in the alignments (query gaps + target gaps) was used as a metric with the rationale that this serves as a proxy for the number of indels in alignments of assembled messenger RNA sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffold clustering and genome anchoring using Hi-C</strong></p>
<p>Hi-C reads were aligned to the polished scaffolds in CB with <font color="red"><strong>Bowtie2</strong></font> (version 2.3.3.1) . Each of the paired reads was aligned independently; then these SE alignments were subsequently merged as recommended by the LACHESIS developers. Based on the alignments, <font color="red">CB scaffolds were <strong>arranged</strong> into <strong>17 ordered</strong> and <strong>oriented</strong> <strong>clusters</strong> using the <strong>LACHESIS</strong> software</font>. As an <font color="blue">internal check</font>, the process was completed on <font color="blue">2 different random 95% sub-samplings of the Hi-C data</font>, as well as on the full data set. The clusters produced by <strong>all 3</strong> of these LACHESIS runs were <font color="blue">identical</font>. <font color="blue">LACHESIS produces groups of scaffolds</font> that are ordered and oriented relative to each other. These scaffold groupings were <font color="blue">compared with the genetic map</font> and the <strong>consistency</strong> of these sources of information was <strong>assessed</strong>. <font color="blue">The SNP probe mapping </font>at the scaffold <strong>validation step</strong> was compared with the clusters produced by LACHESIS.</p>
<p><strong>Illumina assembly</strong></p>
<p>The Illumina data were also assembled on their own, using the de Bruijn graph–based assembler <font color="red"><strong>SOAPdenovo2</strong></font> (version 2.04). <font color="blue"><strong>This assembly</strong></font> was <font color="blue"><strong>used in various ways</strong></font> during the course of the pear genome project (for further scaffold validation, for training the <em>ab initio</em> gene predictors, etc.). <font color="red"><strong>【借鉴】The Illumina data were assembled twice</strong></font>. The <font color="red">first pass</font> contigs were screened using the Kraken software and an index built from the entire RefSeq database. <font color="red">Reads aligning to contaminant contigs were <strong>removed</strong></font> and the remaining data were assembled again.</p>

<p><strong>Phased sequence assembly.</strong> </p>
<p>We ran <font color="red"><strong>Peregrine v.0.1.5.2</strong></font> with the following command line: ‘peregrine asm reads.lst 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 24 –with-consensus –shimmer-r 3 –best_n_ovlp 8–output asm’, where file ‘reads. lst’ gives the list of input read files and directory ‘asm’ holds the output assembly. </p>
<p>We <font color="blue"><strong>mapped Hi-C reads to contigs</strong></font> with <font color="red"><strong>BWA-MEM</strong></font> v.0.7.17 and <font color="blue"><strong>scaffolded</strong></font> the Peregrine contigs with <font color="red"><strong>juicer v.1.5</strong></font> and <font color="red"><strong>3D-DNA v.180922</strong></font>. We preprocessed data with <font color="green"><strong>‘juicer.sh -d juicer -p chrom.sizes -y cut-sites.txt -z contigs.fa -D’</strong></font>, where file <strong>‘cut-sites.txt’</strong> was <strong>generated</strong> using the <strong>generate_site_positions_Arima. py</strong> script, which <strong>outputs merged_nodups.txt</strong>. The scaffolds were produced with <font color="green"><strong>‘run-asm-pipeline.sh -m haploid contigs.fa merged_nodups.txt’</strong></font>. </p>
<p>We then called small variants using DeepVariant v.0.8.0 with the pretrained PacBio model. </p>
<p>We mapped Hi-C reads to the scaffolds and ran HapCUT2 v.1.1 over heterozygous SNP sites to obtain sparse phasing at the chromosome scale. The resulting haplotypes were then combined with PacBio HiFi data using WhatsHap v.0.18, with default parameters, to generate fine-scale, chromosome-long phasing. </p>
<p>We partitioned HiFi reads based on the phases of SNPs residing on these reads, and ran Peregrine again for reads on the same haplotype from the same scaffold. This provided the final phased assembly.</p>

<p>**基础染色体数目的减少 *<em>禾本科染色体数进化（高粱n= 10到甘蔗n= 8）<br>AP85-441基因组的组装显示了</em>S.spontaneum*的染色体数目从10降到8，而这与频繁复制的古复制染色体对相关，通过与高粱的聚类比对，发现高粱祖先5染色体和8号染色体同源物经历了染色体裂变（图2）。SbChr05（A12）的祖先染色体断裂分为两个主要部分，即C5S（A12S）和C5L（A12L），分别转移到SbChr06（A2）和SbChr07（A5）的祖先染色体；SbChr8（A11）的祖先染色体断裂为两个主要的部分，即C8S（A11S）和C8L（A11L），分别转移到SbChr09（A6）和SbChr02（A7+ A9）的祖先染色体中。SbChr8和SsChr5之间及SbChr5和SsChr7之间近乎同源的短片段是在高粱与甘蔗分化前，高粱SSA形成于13.4MYA同源基因的残留物，同时发现，S5中较小的SSA区域和S8中SSA的较大区域在重排的AP85-441基因组中也是保守的。</p>
<p><strong>S.spontaneum的多倍体化分析</strong><br>进一步研究发现了甘蔗（<em>Saccharum spontaneum</em> L.）染色体由高粱（<em>Sorghum</em>）演变进化过程中经历了染色体断裂与融合后，发生了两次WGD事件（图3）；对甘蔗的基因组的多倍化研究中发现，通过两次全基因组复制事件的发生，导致了甘蔗染色体的自发加倍过程；对同源多倍体甘蔗的特异等位基因的鉴定作为本研究的另一亮点，文章在鉴定等位基因的同时，进一步分析研究了等位基因的表达模式，结果发现不同单倍型表达模式相似，并无明显差异；对甘蔗C4光合作用的研究中鉴定了24个基因，7种关键酶参与NADP-MEC4途径；在甘蔗中蔗糖对的积累的研究中发现与高粱相比甘蔗中的液泡膜糖转运蛋白（TSTs，一种蔗糖转运蛋白）发生了基因家族的扩张，所以推测TSTs参与蔗糖在液泡中的积累；<em>S.spontaneum</em>为现代栽培甘蔗提供了抗病性基因，在对其研究中发现，甘蔗中的80％的NBS编码基因位于四个重排染色体（Ss02，Ss05，Ss06和Ss07）上，其中51％位于重排区域。</p>

<p><em>S. spontaneum</em>重排区具有高度的遗传多样性将更适应环境压力，例如对各种非生物胁迫（干旱，盐度，碱性，金属离子等）的反应，这些受到次生细胞生物合成和代谢，跨膜转运和离子结合的控制的基因在这些区域可以检测到。在多倍化事件后，重排区域经历了更强的平衡选择。</p>

<p><strong>Genome assembly overview.</strong> </p>
<p>The sugarcane AP85-441 contig-level assembly incorporated sequencing data from a mixture of sequencing technologies (Supplementary Fig. 1), including BAC pools sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 and whole-genome shotgun sequencing with PacBio RS II as well as Hi-C reads, followed by Illumina short reads polishing. Each BAC pool was independently assembled using <font color="red">ALLPATHS-LG, SPAdes and SOAPdenovo2</font>, and best results were retained. For PacBio assembly, <font color="red"><strong>Canu v1.511</strong></font> was used, as it is capable<br>of avoiding collapsed repetitive regions and haplotypes. Self-correction was performed with parameter corOutCoverage = 100, which allowed us to correct all of the input PacBio reads. The corrected reads, along with BAC-assembled contigs, were imported to the assembly step. <font color="blue">Chromosomal assembly</font> was constructed based on proximity-guided assembly using our newly developed program, <font color="red"><strong>ALLHIC</strong>, which is designed for <strong>polyploid</strong> genome scaffolding</font> (see Supplementary Note for details).</p>

<p><strong>Genome assembly and phasing using PacBio CCS reads.</strong> </p>
<p>A total of 29 Gb CCS reads were assembled using <font color="red"><strong>Canu</strong></font> (v1.91) with the <font color="green"><strong>parameter</strong> –pacbio-hifi</font>.<br>Canu <font color="blue">generated <strong>two</strong> assemblies</font> composed of contigs and unitigs (Supplementary Table 4), and the <font color="blue"><strong>unitig</strong> assembly consisted of the <strong>contigs that split at any alternative paths</strong> in the assembly graph</font>. The contig assembly had longer continuity but more chimeric fragments嵌合体片段 as revealed in the genetic mapping analysis. To avoid the mis-joining of two haplotypes, <font color="red"><strong>the unitig assembly</strong></font> rather than the contig assembly was chosen for the <font color="red"><strong>subsequent analysis</strong></font>. The unitigs were then <font color="blue"><strong>polished</strong> iteratively using <strong>two rounds</strong></font> of <font color="red"><strong>Pilon</strong></font> with ~150 Gb of WGS <strong>Illumina</strong> data, generating the genome <strong>draft RHgv2</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the sequenced reads of RH selfing progeny后代 were mapped to unitigs of RHgv2 to perform <font color="blue"><strong>genetic grouping</strong></font>. Because the unitigs were relatively long (N50 = 2 Mb), windows with a size of 200 kb rather than the whole unitig were used. If the adjacent windows of one unitig showed contrary read distribution, the unitig was defined as chimeric and broken between windows; 40 chimeric unitigs with a total length of 95 Mb were broken. In total, <font color="blue">1.31 Gb of 1.53 Gb sequences were assigned to 24 linkage groups</font>.</p>
<p>After merging, 141 Mb sequences and 5,252 annotated genes of RHgv1 were added to the RHgv2, yielding a 1.67 Gb genome draft with 1.54 Gb sequences assigned to 24 groups, termed RHgv3 (Supplementary Table 6). The sequences from the RHgv1 and RHgv2 assemblies were named as ontctg* and unitig* in the AGP file, respectively (Supplementary Data 3).</p>
<p><strong>Construction of pseudochromosomes.</strong> </p>
<p>As no approach generated satisfactory results on the RH genome, we introduced the group information derived from the genetic mapping to assist the Hi-C application on chromosome-level assembly. The process was performed on RHgv3 including three steps as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><font color="blue"><strong>Align</strong></font>. The 24 previously determined groups were divided into <font color="blue"><strong>two haplotypes</strong> to <strong>generate</strong> <strong>two</strong> <strong>pseudohaploid genome drafts</strong></font>. The 132 Mb sequences that could not be assigned to any group were added to two pseudohaploid genomes. Total <font color="blue">Hi-C reads were <strong>aligned</strong> to <strong>each</strong> pseudohaploid genome using <strong>HiC-Pro</strong> to calculate the <strong>contact frequency</strong></font>. This step <font color="blue">yielded <strong>two bam files</strong> for the two pseudohaploid genomes</font>.</li>
<li><font color="blue"><strong>Rescue</strong></font>. Using the <font color="blue">bam file as input</font>, the <em>rescue</em> function in <font color="red"><strong>ALLHiC</strong></font> was applied to assign unplaced sequences to known groups. Because the 132 Mb <strong>unplaced sequences</strong> were <strong>added</strong> to two pseudohaploid genomes and <strong>processed twice</strong>, the rescued <strong>results were redundant</strong>. For every <strong>unplaced sequence</strong>, we <strong>considered its best Hi-C signal density</strong> to decide the group to which it belonged. After this step, the sequence content of 24 groups was updated with an <strong>extra 75.6 Mb</strong> sequences assigned to proper groups.</li>
<li><font color="blue"><strong>Optimize and build</strong></font>. For each pseudohaploid genome, using <font color="red">the bam file and the updated group file as input</font>, the <font color="red"><strong><em>optimize</em> function in ALLHiC</strong></font> decidedthe <strong>order</strong> and <strong>orientation</strong> of scaffolds for each group; thus, the <font color="red"><strong><em>build</em> function</strong></font> generated fasta sequences on that basis. By performing this step, we identified the pseudochromosomes for 24 groups. The order and orientation of scaffolds on chromosomes are provided in Supplementary Data 3.</li>

<p><strong>Genome size estimation</strong></p>
<p>After trimming off 10x Genomics barcodes and hexamers from the 61.7 Gb reads of the two 10x sc-CNV libraries, k-mer counting (k=21) was performed with <font color="red"><strong>Jellyfish</strong></font>. The k-mer histogram was provided to<font color="red"> <strong>findGSE</strong></font> to estimate the size of the “Rojo Pasión” genome under the heterozygous mode (with “exp_hom=200”; Add- itional file 1: Fig. S3).</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary diploid-genome assembly and curation</strong></p>
<p>With the 19.9 G raw PacBio reads of “Rojo Pasión” (Additional file 1: Fig. S2), a pre-liminary diploid assembly was constructed using <font color="red"><strong>Canu</strong></font> (with options “genome- Size=242500000 corMhapSensitivity=high corMinCoverage=0 corOutCoverage=100 correctedErrorRate=0.105”).</p>
<p>All raw <strong>Illumina reads</strong> from the 10x libraries were <font color="red">firstly <strong>aligned</strong> to the <strong>initial assembly</strong></font> using <font color="red"><strong>bowtie2</strong></font>. Then, the purge haplotigs pipeline was used to remove haplotigs (i.e., haplotype-specific contigs inflating the true haploid genome) based on statistical analysis of sequencing depth and identify primary contigs to build up a curated haploid assembly. To reduce the false-positive rate in defining haplotigs, each haplotig was blasted to the curated assembly; if over 50% of the haplotig could not be covered by any primary contigs, it was re-collected as a primary contig.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allele-aware chromosome-level genome assembly and efficient transgene-free genome editing for the autotetraploid cultivated alfalfa</p>
</blockquote>
<p>（1）使用Canu默认参数，利用CCS clean reads组装contigs。组装得到的Contig N50值为459kb，总长度为3.15GB。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We assembled contigs from CCS clean reads using Canu, with default parameters. The N50 values of the contig sets were 459 kb, with total lengths 3154 Mb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>（2）使用HiC-Pro将Hi-C reads与contigs 进行比对，产生比对BAM文件。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi-C reads were aligned to contigs using <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26619908/">HiC-Pro(2015)</a>, yielding an alignment BAM file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>（3）使用注释的蒺藜苜蓿蛋白作为参考，完全基于同源的策略注释contigs。对138,729个同源基因进行了结构注释。用MCscan用于鉴定contigs和参考基因组之间的共线性。显示紫花苜蓿和蒺藜苜蓿之间的高共线性。【下载父母本petunia ref】</p>

<p>HiC-Pro was designed to process Hi-C data, from <font color="red"><strong>raw fastq files</strong></font> (paired-end Illumina data) to <font color="red"><strong>normalized contact maps</strong></font>. It supports the main Hi-C protocols, including digestion protocols as well as protocols that do not require restriction enzymes such as DNase Hi-C. In practice, HiC-Pro was successfully <font color="blue"><strong>applied to many data-sets</strong></font> including dilution Hi-C, in situ Hi-C, DNase Hi-C, Micro-C, capture-C, capture Hi-C or HiChip data.<br>The pipeline is flexible, scalable and optimized. It can operate either on a single laptop or on a computational cluster. HiC-Pro is sequential and each step of the workflow can be run independantly.<br>HiC-Pro includes a fast implementatation of the iterative correction method (see the <a href="https://github.com/hiclib/iced">iced python package</a> for more information). Finally, HiC-Pro can use phasing data to build <a href="https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro/blob/master/doc/AS.md">allele-specific contact maps</a>.</p>

<p>HiC-Pro需要python版本&gt;=3.7, 安装3.9</p>

<p>yes well done ! So the samtools sort failed.<br>If you look at your command, -@ 36 -m 21M, means that it only has 21Mo to sort the file which is too few.<br>So it has to swap a lot, and generate too many tmp files.<br>This memory parameter is in your configuration file SORT_RAM. By default, it is set to 768M</p>
<p>Actually, the SORT_RAM parameter is divided by the number of CPUs<br>For instance, using 1000M with 4 CPUs means that samtools sort is run with 250M of RAM.<br>So it makes sense … you have 1000M / 36 CPU = 27M of RAM.<br>I would suggest to decrease the number of CPU to 8 for instance … this is enough ! or to increase again the SORT_RAM parameter.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>调度器主要是基于<strong>HPC场景</strong>的<strong>集群任务调度系统</strong>，英文<strong>Cluster Scheduler</strong>、<strong>Job Scheduler</strong>等。</p>
<p>市面主流调度器有四大流派：<font color="red"><strong>LSF   SGE   Slurm   PBS</strong></font></p>
<span id="more"></span>

<h1 id="从Cluster-集群-、Grid-网格-到-Cloud-（云）"><a href="#从Cluster-集群-、Grid-网格-到-Cloud-（云）" class="headerlink" title="从Cluster (集群)、Grid (网格) 到 Cloud （云）"></a>从Cluster (集群)、Grid (网格) 到 Cloud （云）</h1><p>为解决复杂的<strong>计算密集型</strong>和<strong>数据密集型</strong>问题，需要<strong>高网络性能</strong>、<strong>快速存储</strong>、<strong>大量内存</strong>、<strong>超高计算能力</strong>。</p>
<h2 id="Cluster"><a href="#Cluster" class="headerlink" title="Cluster"></a><strong>Cluster</strong></h2><p>一组松散集成的计算机<strong>软件</strong>或<strong>硬件</strong>连接起来<strong>高度紧密地协作</strong>完成计算工作。在某种意义上，可以被看作是一台计算机。集群系统中的<font color="blue"><strong>单个计算机</strong></font>通常称为<font color="blue"><strong>节点node</strong></font>，通常通过<strong>局域网(LAN)连接</strong>,性价比比<font color="blue"><strong>大型机（mainframe）</strong></font>等<strong>高</strong>。</p>
<h2 id="Grid"><a href="#Grid" class="headerlink" title="Grid"></a><strong>Grid</strong></h2><p>通过<strong>利用</strong>大量<strong>异构计算机</strong>的<strong>未用资源</strong>，如<strong>CPU</strong>、<strong>磁盘存储</strong>等，将其作为嵌入在分布式的一个<strong>虚拟的计算机集群</strong>，为解决<strong>大规模计算问题</strong>提供一个<strong>模型</strong>。目标是<font color="blue">解决</font>对单一超级计算机都<font color="blue">困难的大问题</font>，并同时保持解决多个<font color="blue">较小</font>问题的灵活性。网格天生就是在本地网、城域网或广域网上进行分布的。网格<font color="blue">可以分布在任何地方</font>。而<font color="blue">集群</font>物理上都在<font color="blue">一处</font>，通常是<font color="blue">局域网互连</font>。</p>
<h2 id="Cloud"><a href="#Cloud" class="headerlink" title="Cloud"></a><strong>Cloud</strong></h2><p>集群技术发展而来，区别在于<font color="blue">集群虽然把多台机器联起来</font>，但其<font color="blue">某项<strong>具体任务</strong>执行的时候还是会被转发到<strong>某台服务器</strong>上</font>，而<font color="blue">云</font>可以简单认为是<font color="blue">任务被<strong>分割成多个进程</strong>在<strong>多台服务器</strong>上<strong>并行计算</strong></font>，优势是大数据量的操作性能非常好。云可以使用廉价的PC服务器 ，可以<font color="blue"><strong>管理</strong>大数据量与大集群</font>，<font color="blue">关键技术在于能够对云内的基础设施进行动态按需分配与管理</font>。云计算与并行计算、分布式计算的区别，<font color="red">对于计算机用户，<strong>并行计算</strong>由<strong>单个用户完成</strong>，<strong>分布式计算</strong>由<strong>多个用户合作</strong>完成，<strong>云计算</strong>是<strong>没有用户参与</strong>，而是交给<strong>网络另一端的服务器完成</strong>。</font></p>

<p><strong>研究发现</strong>：<strong>商务计算机</strong>只用到其<strong>功能</strong>的 <strong>10％ —20％</strong>。24 小时内，一般的 <strong>UNIX 服务器</strong>只<strong>利用 10％</strong> 的时间，大型机大约 40％，<strong>台式机少于 5％</strong>。同样时间间隔内，利用<strong>网格计算</strong>，<strong>资源利用</strong>可以达到 <strong>90％</strong> 。</p>

<ol>

<h2 id="SGE的常用命令"><a href="#SGE的常用命令" class="headerlink" title="SGE的常用命令"></a>SGE的常用命令</h2><h3 id="任务投递"><a href="#任务投递" class="headerlink" title="任务投递"></a>任务投递</h3><p>SGE中投递任务所用到的命令是<code>qsub</code>. 最简单的用法，即将要执行的命令通过标准输入的方式传递给<code>qsub</code></p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">&quot;ls -l &quot;</span> | qsub</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>投递之后可以用<code>qstat</code>查看任务运行情况，如下图</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/03/06/2022-03-06-Linux-grid/3.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>任务投递情况</p>
<p>第一列是任务编号, 第二列是优先级，第三列是任务名字，在参数里没有特别说明的情况下，SGE会用任务的来源进行命令，STDIN表示来自于标准输入，第四列是用户名，第五列是运行状态(“r”表示运行中), 第六列表示任务投递和开始时间，第七列是任务投递的节点，第8列则是要申请的线程数。在执行完成后会在家目录下生成”STDIN.e7883”和”STDIN.o7883”, 其中7883是任务编号, 前者存放标准错误输出, 后者存放标准输出， 因此”cat STDIN.o7883”的内容就是<code>ls -l</code>的内容。</p>
<p>另一种方法是先写脚本后投递，比如先编辑文件”ls.sh”, 然后用”qsub ls.sh”投递任务。</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls -l</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>跟之前一样，最后在home目录产生了”ls.sh.exxxx”和”ls.sh.exxxx”两个文件</p>
<p>实际肯定没有那么简单，需要增加各种参数来调整<code>qsub</code>的行为，用<code>qsub -help</code>可以看完整参数，但是常用的为如下几个 </p>
<ul>
<li>-q xxx : 指定要投递到的队列，如果不指定的话，SGE会在用户可使用的队列中选择一个满足要求的队列</li>
<li>-V： <font color="red">将当前的环境变量传递到执行命令的节点【在使用PBS时，直接运行可以执行，投递PBS则失败，是任务到了计算节点不识别环境变量？】</font></li>
<li>cwd: 在当前目录下执行任务, sge的日志会输出到当前路径。 不增加该指令，所有投递的任务都会在home目录下执行</li>
<li>-l resource=value: 请求资源数, 例如 <code>-l vf=25G -l h=node1</code> 任务的预估内存要25G(内存估计的值应稍微大于真实内存，内存预估偏小可能会导致节点跑挂), 申请在node1上运行</li>
<li>-S /bin/bash: 表示在bash环境下执行命令。默认tcsh.</li>
<li>-pe openmpi 4: 表示使用openmpi进行并行运算，且申请的线程是4，</li>
<li>-N 任务名: 手动执行任务的名字</li>
<li>-j y|n ：是否将标准输入和标准输入合并成一个文件</li>
<li>-sync y|n: 是否等待任务结束，返回退出码</li>
<li>-o path: 指定标准输出的文件夹</li>
</ul>
<p>接下来就可以添加这些参数运行一些命令，例如在命令行里投递一个比对任务</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">&quot;bowtie2 -p 8 -x index/ref -1 data/A_1.fq -2 data/A_2.fq | samtools sort &gt; A.bam&quot;</span> | qsub -V -cwd -l vf=25G -S /bin/bash -pe openmpi 8 -N A.bt2</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>这些参数除了在<strong>外部设置</strong>外，还可以在shell脚本<strong>内部设置</strong>，如下</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/bin/bash</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#$ -S /bin/bash</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#$ -V</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#$ -cwd</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#$ -l vf=25G</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#$ -pe openmpi 8</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#$ -N a.bt2</span></span><br><span class="line">bowtie2 -p 8 -x index/ref -1 data/A_1.fq -2 data/A_2.fq | samtools sort &gt; A.bam</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="查询任务"><a href="#查询任务" class="headerlink" title="查询任务"></a>查询任务</h3><p>除任务投递外，查询任务也是常用命令，除直接用<code>qstat</code>查看，还有如下参数比较好用</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">qstat -f        <span class="comment"># 查看用户任务</span></span><br><span class="line">qstat -j jobId  <span class="comment"># 按任务id查看</span></span><br><span class="line">qstat -explain a|c|A|E -j jobID <span class="comment"># 查看任务任务并给出解释</span></span><br><span class="line">qstat -u user   <span class="comment"># 按用户查看</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>任务状态：</p>
<ul>
<li>qw: 表示等待状态</li>
<li>hqw: 任务挂起等待中，待依赖的任务完成后执行</li>
<li>Eqw: 投递任务出错</li>
<li>r: 表示任务正在运行</li>
<li>s: 暂时挂起</li>
<li>dr: 节点挂了之后，删除任务就会出现这个状态，只有节点重启后，任务才会消失</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="删除任务"><a href="#删除任务" class="headerlink" title="删除任务"></a>删除任务</h3><p>任务删除也比较重要，偶尔会出现任务投递出错的情况</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">qdel -j 1111   删除任务号为1111的任务</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="其他命令"><a href="#其他命令" class="headerlink" title="其他命令"></a>其他命令</h3><ul>
<li><p>qrsh：与qsub相比，是交互式的投递任务，注意参数:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">-now yes|no</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>默认设置为yes</p>
<ul>
<li>若设置为yes，<font color="blue">立即调度作业</font>，如果没有可用资源，则拒绝作业，任务投递失败，任务状态为Eqw。</li>
<li>若设置为no，调度时如果没有可用资源，则将作业<font color="blue">排入队列</font>，等待调度。</li>
<li>例子： qrsh -l vf=*G -q all.q -now no -w n *sh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>qacct 从集群日志中抽取任意账户信息</p>
</li>
<li><p>qalter 更改已提交但正处于暂挂状态的作业的属性</p>
</li>
<li><p>qconf 为集群和队列配置提供用户界面</p>
<ul>
<li><code>qconf -spl</code>查看可用并行环境</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>qhold 阻止已提交作业的执行</p>
</li>
<li><p>qhost 显示<font color="blue">SGE执行主机</font>（即<font color="blue">各个计算节点</font>）的<font color="blue">状态信息</font></p>
<ul>
<li><code>qhost -j</code>按照节点显示任务</li>
<li><code>qhost -F</code>展示每个节点的资源</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>qlogin 启动telnet或类似的登录会话。</p>

<p>不同行业因使用习惯和不同调度器对应用的支持力度不同，往往有不同偏好：<strong>比如高校和超算经常用Slurm，半导体公司最常用的是LSF和SGE，工业制造业可能用PBS更多一些。</strong></p>

<li><strong>怎么能让集群整体资源利用率最高？跑更多任务？</strong></li>
<li><strong>能不能指定特定任务在某种类型计算节点上运行？</strong></li>
<li><strong>任务之间存在先后顺序，能否确保特定任务一定先运行？</strong></li>
<li><strong>怎么统计和限制不同用户的用量？</strong></li>
<li><strong>怎么监控每个节点的状态和使用情况？</strong></li>

<p><strong>基于这几家主流调度器：LSF/SGE/Slurm/PBS以及它们的不同演化版本进行了梳理和盘点，尤其是对云的支持方面划了重点。</strong></p>
<h2 id="LSF"><a href="#LSF" class="headerlink" title="LSF"></a>LSF</h2><p><strong>基于LSF（Load Sharing Facility）的调度器主要有Spectrum LSF、PlatformLSF、OpenLava三家。</strong></p>
<p>早期LSF由Toronto大学开发的Utopia系统发展而来。<br>2007年，<strong>Platform Computing</strong>基于早期老版本的LSF开源了一个简化版Platform Lava。</p>
<p>这个开源项目2011年中止了，被<strong>OpenLava</strong>接手。<br>2011年，Platform员工David Bigagli基于Platform Lava的派生代码创建了OpenLava 1.0。2014年，一些Platform的员工成立了Teraproc公司，为OpenLava提供开发和商业支持。<strong>2016年IBM就LSF版权对Teraproc公司发起诉讼，2018年IBM胜诉，OpenLava被禁用。</strong></p>
<p>2011年，Platform Lava开源项目中止后。<strong>2012年1月，IBM收购了Platform Computing。Spectrum LSF</strong>就是IBM收购后推出的商用版本，目前更新到10.1.0，同时支持Linux和Windows，<font color="red">最大节点数超过6000，在国内提供商业支持。</font><br><strong>Platform LSF</strong>是LSF的早期版本，与Spectrum LSF一样属于IBM，目前版本是9.1.3，目测已经停止更新以维护为主。</p>
<h2 id="SGE"><a href="#SGE" class="headerlink" title="SGE"></a>SGE</h2><p><strong>基于SGE（Sun Grid Engine）的调度器包括UGE（Univa Grid Engine）和SGE（Son of Grid Engine）。</strong></p>
<p>1993年，<strong>Grid Engine</strong>作为商业软件发布，先后使用了<strong>CODINE</strong>（Computing in Distributed Networked Environments）、<strong>GRD</strong>（Global Resource Director）作为名称。1999年，第一次由Genias Software推出市场，然后被Gridware公司收购。直到2000年被SUN收购之后正式改名<strong>Sun Grid Engine</strong>，2001年发布开源版。</p>
<p>2010年被Oracle收购后改名<strong>Oracle Grid Engine</strong>，改成闭源版，不提供源代码。原来开源项目的资料库禁止用户修改。<br>于是，Grid Engine社区开始开源版本的<strong>SGE</strong>（<strong>Son of Grid Engine</strong>）项目。该调度器最后一次更新为2016年的8.1.9，由于存在版权风险，SGE已长期无维护和更新。</p>
<p>2013年Univa收购了Oracle Grid Engine，成为唯一商业软件<strong>UGE（Univa Grid Engine）</strong>提供商。UGE最新版本为8.6.15，同时支持Linux和Windows，国内暂无商业支持的相关信息。<br>2020年9月，Altair收购了Univa。</p>
<h2 id="Slurm-四大流派里唯一纯开源派"><a href="#Slurm-四大流派里唯一纯开源派" class="headerlink" title="Slurm 四大流派里唯一纯开源派"></a>Slurm <strong>四大流派里唯一纯开源派</strong></h2><p><font color="red"><strong>Slurm全称为Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management</strong></font>，前期主要由劳伦斯利弗莫尔国家实验室、SchedMD、Linux NetworX、Hewlett-Packard 和 Groupe Bull 负责开发，受到闭源软件Quadrics RMS的启发。</p>
<p>Slurm最新版本为20.02，目前由社区和SchedMD公司共同维护，<strong>保持开源和免费</strong>，由SchedMD公司提供商业支持，仅支持Linux系统，<font color="red">最大节点数量超过12万</font>。<br>Slurm拥有<font color="red">容错率高、支持异构资源、高度可扩展等优点，每秒可提交超过1000个任务，且由于是开放框架，高度可配置，拥有超过100种插件，因此适用性相当强。</font></p>
<p><strong>全球60%的TOP500超算中心和超大规模集群（包括我国的天河二号等）都采用Slurm作为调度系统。我们的TOP500就是用Slurm调度云上资源跑的。</strong><a href="https://fastonetech.com/blog/top500/">上榜啦～花费4小时5500美元，速石科技跻身全球超算TOP500</a></p>

<h2 id="PBS"><a href="#PBS" class="headerlink" title="PBS"></a>PBS</h2><p><strong>基于PBS（Portable Batch System）的调度器包括OpenPBS、PBS PRO、Moab/TORQUE。</strong></p>
<p>PBS最初是由MRJ Technology Solutions于 1991 年 6 月开始为 <font color="red">NASA 所研发的作业调度系统</font>，MRJ于 20 世纪90 年代末被 Veridian 收购。2003年，Altair收购了Veridian，获得了PBS的技术和知识产权。<br><font color="red"><strong>PBS Pro</strong></font>是Altair旗下PBS WORKS提供的<font color="red">商业版本，支持可视化界面，节点数超过50000个。</font></p>
<p>2016年Altair基于<strong>PBS Pro</strong>提供了开源许可版本，其与MRJ于1998年发布的原始开源版本两者合二为一大致就是现在的<font color="red"><strong>OpenPBS</strong></font>。<font color="red">与Pro版本比，多了很多限制，但都支持Linux和Windows。</font></p>
<p><strong>Moab/TORQUE合在一起是一个完整调度器的功能，现在属于同一家公司Adaptive Computing。</strong>90年代中期由MHPCC的David Jackson开发的Maui，他后来创立了Adaptive Computing。</p>
<p><strong>Moab</strong>是Adaptive Computing 公司（前身为 Cluster Resources 公司开发的Maui Cluster Scheduler）维护的 OpenPBS 分支，2003年发布。该项目最初是开源免费的，后来变成了商用软件Moab后不再免费。</p>
<p><strong>TORQUE</strong>（Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager）早期的 Torque 也是开源免费软件，不过 2018 年 6 月开始 TORQUE 不再开源。<br><font color="red">两者均只支持Linux系统，提供可视化界面，拥有约数千个节点。</font></p>
<p>云服务方面，PBS Pro能通过<strong>Altair Control产品</strong>从本地溢出到多云和Auto-Scale集群自动伸缩，支持的云厂商包括AWS、Azure和Google Cloud。</p>
<p>Moab/TORQUE 则可通过 <strong>NODUSCloud OS 产品</strong>实现本地扩展到云，支持TORQUE 或 Slurm集群和自动伸缩，可支持的云厂商包括AWS、Azure、GoogleCloud 和华为云，并通过 Account Manager 产品实现云端费用监控。</p>

<p>普遍通用的单拷贝直系同源测试?</p>

<p>BUSCO是使用python语言编写的<font color="blue">对<strong>转录组</strong>和<strong>基因组组装质量</strong>进行<strong>评估</strong></font>的软件。相近物种间总有一些保守序列，BUSCO<font color="blue">使用这些<strong>保守序列</strong>与<strong>组装结果</strong>进行<strong>比对</strong></font>，鉴定组装结果是否包含这些序列，包含单条、多条还是部分或者不包含等情况给出结果</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BUSCO 软件根据<strong>OrthoDB 数据库</strong>，构建了<strong>几个大的进化分支</strong>的<strong>单拷贝基因集</strong>。将转录本拼接结果<strong>与该基因集比较</strong>，根据比对上的比例、完整性，来评价拼接结果的<strong>准确性和完整性</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>基于大量物种的<font color="blue">单拷贝基因构建数据集</font>，用于评估<font color="blue"><strong>基因组组装，转录组组装，基因注释，蛋白集的完整性</strong></font>。core-genes 构建方式，90%物种共享的基因即为核心基因。使用的是直系同源基因家族的概念，基于100个物种基因组，某一个基因家族存在于&gt;90个基因组中，即将该基因家族认定为核心基因</p>
<p>BUSCO使用其他工具搭建流程</p>

<p>一般<code>S</code> + <code>D</code>的数值也就是<code>C</code>的值越大越好，但是在文献中作者说如果<code>D</code>的数值太多的话可能意味着组装错误的可能性较大。因为一个基因（BUSCO数据库中该基因一般为单拷贝）被覆盖多次，那么可能就是说该基因所在的片段组装可能出现问题。<br>因为理论上</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">理论上：--------------------------------------------</span><br><span class="line">实际上：--------   ----------    ----------    -----</span><br><span class="line">错误的：--------                 -------------</span><br><span class="line">           \\\\                    ///</span><br><span class="line">          -----------     --------------</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>理论上组装之后各个片段之间应该前后有序，之间除了重复区域或者其他特殊片段之外不应该有可以重叠的地方。<br>例如</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sequence1 : ..TAGTCGTGA                         GTGCATGCTGTAGC..</span><br><span class="line">                       \                       /</span><br><span class="line">                        AAAATTGG......CGATGAAAA</span><br><span class="line">                       /                       \</span><br><span class="line">sequence2 : ..GGGTAGCGG                         TTGACTAGCTAGCT..</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>也就是说中间一段序列是两个序列的共同部分，除非这个序列存在多个拷贝，否则就很可能是拼接错误。通常一般这种拼接错误的序列的两端会出现重复序列。另外如果是多倍体组装的话，<code>D</code>值也可能大。</p>
<p>一般来看，<code>S</code>似乎越大越好，<code>M</code>越小越好，说明组装的越完整，因为检测的单拷贝同源基因出现得多。但是<code>D</code>与<code>F</code>这两个数值越大不见得就是好的，因为组装的错误可能会带来这两个值的增大。不能仅仅只是通过这一个软件来判定。比如还可以借助<code>QUAST</code>和常规指标<code>N50</code>、<code>总的核酸量</code>、<code>点阵图</code>等等多个辅助标准来进行综合的评估。</p>

    <title>【paper】Insight into the evolution of the Solanaceae from the parental genomes of Petunia hybrida</title>

<span id="more"></span>

<h1 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h1><p>The assemblies include 91.3% and 90.2% coverage of their diploid genomes (1.4 Gb; 2n = 14) containing 32,928 and 36,697 protein-coding genes, respectively. The genomes reveal that the Petunia lineage has experienced at least two rounds of hexaploidization: the older gamma event, which is shared with most Eudicots, and a more recent Solanaceae event that is shared with tomato and other solanaceous species. Transcription factors involved in the shift from bee to moth pollination reside in particularly dynamic regions of the genome, which may have been key to the remarkable diversity of floral colour patterns and pollination systems. The high-quality genome sequences will enhance the value of Petunia as a model system for research on unique biological phenomena such as small RNAs, symbiosis, self-incompatibility and circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>矮牵牛是一种流行的花坛植物，作为一种遗传学模式系统有着悠久的历史。我们报道了其两个野生亲本腋毛假单胞菌(P. axillaris N)和膨胀假单胞菌(P. inflata S6)近交系衍生物的全基因组测序和组装。该组合的二倍体基因组覆盖率为91.3%和90.2% (1.4 Gb;2n = 14)，分别含有32,928个和36,697个蛋白编码基因。基因组显示矮矮花至少经历了两轮六倍化:更古老的伽玛事件，与大多数双子叶植物共享，以及更近的茄科事件，与番茄和其他茄科植物共享。转录因子参与了从蜜蜂到飞蛾的传粉过程，它们位于基因组中特别活跃的区域，这可能是花的颜色模式和传粉系统显著多样性的关键。高质量的基因组序列将提高矮种矮花作为研究小rna、共生、自交不亲和性和昼夜节律等独特生物现象的模型系统的价值。</p>
<p>矮牵牛（<em>Petunia hybrida</em>）属于茄科（Solanaceae），是一种流行的花坛植物，长期作为一个遗传模式系统。本论文报道了矮牵牛的两个野生亲本的基因组，<em>P. axillaris</em> N 和 <em>P. inflata</em> S6。The assemblies include 91.3% and 90.2% coverage of their diploid genomes (1.4 Gb; 2n = 14) containing 32,928 and 36,697 protein-coding genes, respectively. 组装的基因组矮牵牛的基因组大小大约是1.4Gb，14对染色体。报道的两个基因组分别注释到32928和36697个编码蛋白基因。</p>
<p><em>P. axillaris</em> N 基因组的组装利用了137 X的二代测序（Illumina）数据和 21 X三代测序（PacBio）技术数据，<em>P. inflata</em> S6 基因组的组装利用了 135 X 的二代测序数据，测序深度都不低。相信矮牵牛基因组的发布会推动自交不亲和、花色等方面的研究。</p>

<h3 id="2-组装质量显著提升"><a href="#2-组装质量显著提升" class="headerlink" title="2 组装质量显著提升"></a>2 组装质量显著提升</h3><p>由于HiFi 与Illunima短Reads具有相当的碱基准确性，因此在组装上具有CLR和Nanopore无法比拟的优势。利用HiFi 对人基因组组装结果表明，<font color="red"><strong>HiFi 组装质量比CLR高6倍，比经Illumina校正的Nanopore高77倍</strong></font> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31406327/">[1]</a>。</p>
<p>值得一提，利用HiFi 和Nanopore 进行水稻组装文章表明，<font color="red"><strong>对于高重复区域利用高质量Illumina对Nanopore长Reads纠错效果一般</strong></font>。原因在于Illumina<font color="blue">短Reads在重复区域很难准确比对</font>，导致<strong>覆盖深度有限</strong>，因而<strong>无法起到准确纠错的作用</strong>。而HiFi 兼具长读长和高准确性双重优势，对<font color="red"><strong>重复区域</strong>仍然能够获得<strong>较高</strong>的组装<strong>质量</strong></font>。</p>

<p>b) Dot plot of a <strong>6.7 kbp VNTR</strong> in the <strong>intron</strong> of <em>RTEL1</em> (chr20:63693361–63693833) (top panel), <strong>which was resolved in the HiFi assembly only</strong>. The <strong>CLR assembly</strong> contained a <strong>gap</strong> over this region. The overall structure and length of this VNTR was <strong>supported by the ONT reads</strong> mapping to this location, which averaged 5,956 +/− 1799 bp (n = 5 ultra-long ONT reads), placing the HiFi sequence length at &lt;1 standard deviation away from the average ONT read. The motif homology plot (bottom panel) indicates that the content of the <em>RTEL1</em> VNTR is relatively pure, with an average sequence identity to the 15-mer repeat unit of 94.49% across the 439 copies.</p>

The number of copies of this <strong>35 bp repeat unit</strong> increased from <strong>15 in the CLR</strong> assembly to <strong>89 in the HiFi</strong> assembly. The large amount of variation between individual copies of this VNTR is shown in the region between the <strong>red lines</strong> in the motif homology plots (bottom panels). The <strong>level of purity within the VNTR increased</strong> from 80.38% sequence identity in the CLR assembly to 90.75% sequence identity in the HiFi assembly.

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" class="headerlink" title="introduction"></a>introduction</h2><p>Hifiasm is a <font color="blue"><strong>fast haplotype-resolved de novo assembler</strong></font> for <font color="blue"><strong>PacBio HiFi reads</strong></font>. It can <strong>assemble a human genome in several hours</strong> and assemble a <strong>~30Gb</strong> California redwood genome in <strong>a few days</strong>. Hifiasm emits <font color="red"><strong>partially phased assemblies</strong></font> of quality competitive with the best assemblers. Given <font color="green"><strong>parental short reads</strong></font> or <font color="green"><strong>Hi-C data</strong></font>, it produces arguably <font color="red"><strong>the best haplotype-resolved assemblies</strong></font> so far.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Hifiasm"><a href="#Why-Hifiasm" class="headerlink" title="Why Hifiasm?"></a>Why Hifiasm?</h2><ul>
<li>Hifiasm delivers high-quality assemblies. It tends to generate <font color="blue">longer contigs</font> and resolve <font color="blue">more segmental duplications</font> than other assemblers.</li>
<li>Given <font color="blue">Hi-C reads</font> or <font color="blue">short reads from the parents</font>, hifiasm can produce overall <font color="blue"><strong>the best haplotype-resolved assembly</strong></font> so far. It is the assembler of choice by the <a href="https://humanpangenome.org/">Human Pangenome Project</a> for the first batch of samples.</li>
<li>Hifiasm can <font color="blue">purge duplications?</font> between haplotigs without relying on third-party tools such as purge_dups. Hifiasm does <font color="blue">not need polishing tools?</font> like pilon or racon, either. This simplifies the assembly pipeline and saves running time.</li>
<li>Hifiasm is <font color="blue">fast</font>. It can assemble a human genome in half a day and assemble a ~30Gb redwood genome in three days. <font color="blue">No genome is too large for hifiasm</font>.</li>
<li>Hifiasm is trivial to install and easy to use. It does not required Python, R or C++11 compilers, and can be compiled into a single executable. The default setting works well with a variety of genomes.</li>

<h2 id="原理介绍1"><a href="#原理介绍1" class="headerlink" title="原理介绍1"></a>原理介绍1</h2><p>hifiasm有效利用PacBio HiFi测序技术，在<font color="red"><strong>分型组装图(pahsed assembly gprah)</strong></font>中可靠的表示单倍体信息。</p>
<p><strong>第一阶段</strong>：通过所有序列相互比对，对潜在测序错误纠正。如果<font color="red">一个位置只存在两种碱基类型</font>，且每个碱基类型<font color="red">至少有3条read支持</font>，那么这个位置会被当作<font color="red">杂合位点</font>，否则视作测序错误纠正。</p>
<p><strong>第二阶段</strong>：根据<font color="red">序列之间重叠关系</font>，构建<font color="red">分型的字符串图(phased string graph)</font>。其中调整朝向的序列作为<font color="red">顶点(vertex)</font>，一致重叠作为<font color="red">边(edge)</font>。字符串图中的<font color="red">气泡(bubble)</font>则是<font color="red">杂合位点</font>。</p>
<p><strong>第三阶段</strong>：如果没有额外的信息，hifiasm会<font color="red">随机选择气泡一边</font>构建primary assembly，另一边则是alternate assembly. 该策略和HiCanu，Falcon-Unzip一样。对于杂合基因组而言，由于存在一个以上的纯合haplotype，因此<font color="red">primary assembly可能还会包含haplotigs</font>。HiCanu依赖第三方的purge_dups, 而hifiasm内部实现purge_dups算法的变种，简化了流程。如果有<font color="red">额外信息</font>，hifiasm可正确的对<font color="red">haplotype进行分型</font>。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/03/02/2022-03-02-HiFi-3-software/1.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="hifiasm-原理介绍2"><a href="#hifiasm-原理介绍2" class="headerlink" title="hifiasm 原理介绍2"></a>hifiasm 原理介绍2</h2><p><strong>可识别单倍型的纠错</strong></p>
<p>Hifiasm将所有hifi reads读取到内存中进行<font color="red"><strong>all-vs-all比对并纠错</strong></font>。基于reads间overlap信息，如果read上有一个碱基与其他碱基不同，并有<font color="red"><strong>至少3条reads支持</strong></font>，则认为它是<font color="red"><strong>SNP</strong></font>并保留，<strong>否则</strong>认为是错误并<strong>纠正</strong>。</p>
<p><strong>组装图的构建</strong></p>
<p>在校正之后，大多数错误被去除，同时<font color="red"><strong>杂合变异信息被保留</strong></font>。基于这些信息，Hifiasm构建了<font color="red"><strong>以reads为顶点、重叠区为边的定相string-graph</strong></font>。</p>
<p><strong>组装序列的生成</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>如果<font color="red">没有其他数据</font>，Hifiasm在输出序列时会<font color="red"><strong>任意选择</strong>每个气泡<strong>bubble</strong>的<strong>一侧输出</strong>类似<strong>Falcon unzip</strong>和<strong>HiCanu</strong>的主要组装结果</font>（primary contigs）。</p>
</li>
<li><p>如果同时有<font color="red">父母本的测序数据</font>，Hifiasm可以通过<font color="red">亲本特有的kmer</font>在图上<font color="red">识别来自父母本的序列</font>，得到<font color="red"><strong>两套单倍体</strong>基因组</font>。</p>
</li>
<li><p>当然HiFiasm文章中也提到：</p>
<p>与其他基于图形的汇编程序不同，HiFiasm致力于<strong>保持所有单倍型的连续性。</strong><br><font color="red"><strong>HiCanu</strong>只试图<strong>保持一个亲本单倍型</strong>的<strong>连续性</strong></font>，并且经常<font color="red">破坏另一个单倍型的连续性</font>，当分离亲本单倍型时，这些突变点将导致单倍型分解的碎片—HiCanu<font color="red">没有充分利用HiFi Reads</font><br>Hifiasm针对HiFi特点开发，在hifi数据的组装表现上较同类软件更为突出，在多个基因组上表现出了更高的<strong>准确性</strong>和组装的<strong>连续性</strong>。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="仅HiFi数据模式"><a href="#仅HiFi数据模式" class="headerlink" title="仅HiFi数据模式"></a>仅HiFi数据模式</h2><p>最基本的用法，会得到两个部分分型的组装</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wget https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm/releases/download/v0.7/chr11-2M.fa.gz</span><br><span class="line">hifiasm -o <span class="built_in">test</span> -t 32 chr11-2M.fa.gz 2&gt; test.log</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#-o输出文件前缀 -t线程</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>结果文件关注如下几项 (prefix为前缀）</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prefix.bp.r_utg.gfa</code>: haplotype-resolved raw unitig graph，记录所有的单倍型信息</li>
<li><code>prefix.bp.p_utg.gfa</code>: 在raw unitig graph基础上过滤小的bubble，</li>
<li><code>prefix.bp.p_ctg.gfa</code>: 主要contig的assembly graph</li>
<li><code>prefix.bp.hap1.p_ctg.gfa</code>: haplotype1的部分分型的contig graph</li>
<li><code>prefix.bp.hap2.p_ctg.gfa</code>: haplotype2的部分分型的contig graph</li>
</ul>
<p>如果并不需要部分分型的组装，只要primary和alternate的组装结果，可以在之前命令的基础上，加上 <code>--primary</code>参数。</p>

<p>由于hifiasm运行时会将步骤中纠错和相互比对的结果保存成 bin 文件，因此rerun速度很快(前缀名差异)。</p>
<p>primay模式下输出的文件和之前的类似，唯一的不同在于没有 <strong>bp</strong></p>
<p>prefix<code>.r_utg.gfa</code>: haplotype-resolved raw unitig graph: 保留了组装生成的所有单体型信息，包括体细胞突变和重复的测序错误。</p>
<p>prefix<code>.p_utg.gfa</code>: haplotype-resolved processed unitig graph without small bubbles：无小气泡的单倍型解析；去掉由于体细胞突变和数据背景噪音引起的small bubbles（这个并不是真正的单体型信息），对于高度杂合基因组物种优先选择这个结果。</p>
<p>prefix<code>.p_ctg.gfa</code>: assembly graph of primary contigs：对于低杂合度物种来说，优先选择该文件；对于高杂合度物种，该结果代表其中一个单倍型。</p>

<p>输出和之前类似，主要关注文件名<font color="red">带 dip 的输出gfa文件</font></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>prefix.r_utg.gfa</strong>(Haplotype-resolved raw unitig graph in GFA format):保存了所有的单倍型信息。</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><code>prefix.dip.hap1.p_ctg.gfa</code>: 完成分型的<font color="red"><strong>父源单倍体 contig图</strong></font>。(Phased paternal/haplotype1 contig graph):保留了阶段性父系/单倍型1组装。</li>
<li><code>prefix.dip.hap2.p_ctg.gfa</code>: 完全分型的<font color="red"><strong>母源单倍体contig图</strong></font>。(Phased maternal/haplotype2 contig graph):保留了阶段性母系/单倍型2组装。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="附加Hi-C模式"><a href="#附加Hi-C模式" class="headerlink" title="附加Hi-C模式"></a>附加Hi-C模式</h2><p>由于Hi-C数据能够提供<strong>远距信息</strong>，因此也能<strong>用于单倍体分型</strong>。需要加两个参数， h1为Hi-C的read1, h2 为Hi-C的read2</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hifiasm -o NA12878.asm -t 32 --h1 read1.fq.gz --h2 read2.fq.gz HiFi-reads.fq.gz</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>在该模式下，每个contig要么是来自于父亲，要么是来自于母亲。hifiasm将<font color="red">同一来源的contig放在同一个组装中</font>。需要注意的是，hifiasm未必能够处理好<font color="red">着丝粒附近区域</font>，另外<font color="red">hifiasm中Hi-C也不会用于进行scaffold</font>。</p>
<p>输出结果重点关注带hic的文件</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prefix.hic.p_ctg.gfa</code>: 主要contig的组装图</li>
<li><code>prefix.hic.hap1.p_ctg.gfa</code>: 完全分型的haplotype1的contig图</li>
<li><code>prefix.hic.hap2.p_ctg.gfa</code>: 完全分型的haplotype2的contig图</li>
<li><code>prefix.hic.a_ctg.gfa</code> : 如果设置了 <code>--primary</code>参数，还会输出该次要contig的组装图</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="日志和参数调整"><a href="#日志和参数调整" class="headerlink" title="日志和参数调整"></a>日志和参数调整</h2><p>绝大部分的时候，只需要使用默认参数即可得到相对比较好的结果。但是当默认参数无法达到目的，就需要检查日志信息，阅读相关参数从而优化结果。</p>
<p>日志信息主要分三项</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="red">k-mer图</font>: 纯合样本一个peak，杂合样本2个peak。</li>
<li><font color="red">纯合峰的覆盖度</font>: <code>[M::purge_dups] homozygous read coverage threshold: X</code> , 一般会由hifiasm自动推断。</li>
<li><font color="red">杂合/纯合碱基数目（Hi-C模式）</font>: Hi-C模式下，如果纯合的碱基数超过杂合碱基数，那么hifiasm就不容易找对纯合read的所在峰。</li>
</ul>
<p>对于日志信息，最主要关注<font color="red">k-mer图</font>，从而判断hifiasm是否能够正确的找到纯合峰，杂合峰所在位置。如果hifiasm没有找对纯合峰所在的位置，就需要<font color="red">根据k-mer图手动指定?</font> <code>--hom-cov</code>。</p>
<p>对于一个组装结果，最直接的<strong>评估标准</strong>就是<font color="red">基因组大小是否符合预期</font>，分型的<font color="red">两套基因组是否相差不大</font>，序列<strong>是否足够长</strong>，<strong>是否存在错误组装</strong>的情况。</p>
<p>如果基因组<font color="red"><strong>大小不符合预期</strong></font>，一般都是hifiasm<strong>找错纯合峰的位置</strong>，需要手动指定 <code>--hom-cov</code>；</p>
<p>如果分型的两套基因组<font color="red"><strong>差别过大</strong></font>，则通过降低 <code>-s</code> 调整。</p>
<p>如果<font color="red"><strong>序列不够长，片段化明显</strong></font>，则可尝试<font color="red">增加</font>  <code>-D</code> 和  <code>-N</code>, 虽增加运行时间，但会<font color="red">提高重复区域的分辨率</font>。</p>
<p>如果后续的Hi-C，或者BioNano发现hifiasm组装结果<font color="red"><strong>有比较多错误组装</strong></font>，则可以适当降低 <code>--purge-max</code>, <code>-s</code>和 <code>-O</code>。或者设置 <code>-u</code> 关闭post-join 步骤，hifiasm通过该步骤提高组装的连续性。</p>

<h2 id="Advice"><a href="#Advice" class="headerlink" title="Advice"></a>Advice</h2><h3 id="后续分析要去冗余"><a href="#后续分析要去冗余" class="headerlink" title="后续分析要去冗余"></a>后续分析要去冗余</h3><p>Canu2.0之前的contig尽管运行日志说没有bubble，其实是没有检测到。Canu2.0才加上该信息。但作者强烈推荐先用purge_dups去冗余，避免软件难以检测到的冗余序列存在影响后续分析。</p>
<p>作者：旧版Canu没有真正检测到bubble，因此contig包含着buble，建议后续分析用purge_dups 处理这些冗余序列</p>
<p>Canu改动基本上是增加新功能，提高组装准确性，提高组装速度，常规bug修复。</p>
<p>1.8版本更改了Nanopore的错误率，提高10倍左右组装速度，同时完整支持了trio-binning</p>
<p>1.9版开始增加PacBio的HiFi数据，极大提高相互比对速度</p>
<p>这些修改，可以直接将组装得到的contig用于后续分析</p>
<p>而2.0做了许多优化用来保证contig组装更长更准确，其中一个是在contig构建期间会检测bubbles, 防止他们打断杂合基因组</p>
<p>例如组装发现染色体明显偏大，用新Canu组装该物种时候发现，前后两次组装结果在bubbles一栏有明显差别。1.8版本是0，2.0版本是136，约6M基因组大小。</p>
<p>查看之前所有组装物种的日志，发现bubble一栏都是0（即便是杂合基因组）。</p>
<p>意味着，2.0版本装的基因组不能直接用于下游的HiC，而需要先把bubble这部分序列给过滤掉，不然基因组偏离实际值。</p>
<h3 id="高杂合物种组装"><a href="#高杂合物种组装" class="headerlink" title="高杂合物种组装"></a>高杂合物种组装</h3><p>高杂合物种组装，Canu建议是用 <code>batOptions=-dg 3 -db 3 -dr 1 -ca 500 -cp 50</code>参数尽量分出两套单倍型，然后对基因组去冗余。</p>
<p><code>batOptions</code>表示传递后续的参数给组装软件<code>bogart</code>, <code>-dg 3 -db3</code>降低自动确定阈值时的错误率离差(deviation)，从而更好分开单倍型。<code>-dr 1 -ca 500 -cp 50</code>会影响错误组装的拆分，对于一个模棱两可的contig，如果另一条可选路径的overlap长度至少是500bp，或另一条可选路径时在长度上和当前最佳路径存在50%的差异，那么将contig拆分。</p>
<p>关于杂合物种组装的讨论，参考<a href="https://links.jianshu.com/go?to=https://github.com/marbl/canu/issues/201%23issuecomment-233750764">https://github.com/marbl/canu/issues/201#issuecomment-233750764</a></p>
<h3 id="购买SSD避免服务器IO瓶颈"><a href="#购买SSD避免服务器IO瓶颈" class="headerlink" title="购买SSD避免服务器IO瓶颈"></a>购买SSD避免服务器IO瓶颈</h3><p>如果服务器线程数很多，在普通机械硬盘上组装，而且系统还是CentOS，那么需要调整一个参数，避免其中一步的IO严重影响服务器性能。</p>
<p>Canu通过两个策略进行并行，bucketizing (‘ovb’ 任务) 和 sorting (‘ovs’ 任务)。 bucketizing会从1-overlap读取输出的overlap，将他们<strong>复制</strong>一份作为中间文件。sorting一步将这些文件加载到内存中进行排序然后<strong>写出</strong>到硬盘上。 如果你的overlap输出特别多，那么该步骤将会瞬间挤爆的你的IO.</p>
<p>为了避免悲剧发生，请增加如下参数: <code>ovsMemory=16G ovbConcurrency=15 ovsConcurrency=15</code>， 也就是降低这两步同时投递的任务数，缓解IO压力。</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="fastq压缩之gzip文件大小与样本数据量关系"><a href="#fastq压缩之gzip文件大小与样本数据量关系" class="headerlink" title="fastq压缩之gzip文件大小与样本数据量关系"></a>fastq压缩之gzip文件大小与样本数据量关系</h1><span id="more"></span>

<p>ref : <a href="https://www.zxzyl.com/archives/1011">https://www.zxzyl.com/archives/1011</a></p>
<p>测序时，先拿到的是样本fastq压缩后的gz文件，若关心数据量够不够，则需计算fastq.gz文件大小和测序数据量的关系。</p>
<p>用Miseq测序数据（gz文件200M），Hiseq panel（gz文件50M）和WES测序数据（gz文件4G）进行简单分析。发现，<font color="green"><strong>虽然R1和R2数据量是一样，解压出来的文件大小一样，但R2的gzip文件总比R1大</strong></font>。不管是Miseq还是Hiseq的panel测序，压缩后的R2均大于R1文件，且文件越小，差异越大。</p>
<p>因R1和R2数据量相同，只看R1的真实文件和gz文件大小与数据量之间的关系。<br><font color="green"><strong>数据量</strong></font>=FASTQ文件行数/4x<font color="green"><strong>151</strong></font>/1000/<font color="green"><strong>1000</strong></font> 单位为<strong>M</strong><br><font color="green"><strong>真实文件大小估计</strong></font>=FASTQ文件行数/4x<font color="green"><strong>357</strong></font>/1024/<font color="green"><strong>1024</strong></font> 单位为<strong>M</strong>，预测值，差别不大，<strong>因为FASTQ文件中每四行357个字符</strong>（和平台和设置有关系），每个字符1byte。</p>
<p>GZ文件大小通过ll -h查看</p>
<p>因为FASTQ文件是<strong>规范</strong>的，<strong>每四行字符基本一致</strong>，所以<font color="green"><strong>FASTQ真实文件大小和数据量成正比</strong></font>。<strong>前面提到每四行有357个字符，其中序列只占151个字符，FASTQ文件大小大概是测序量的357/151≈2.3倍多</strong>。但因FASTQ文件为文本文件，占用空间较大，所以一般将FASTQ文件压缩成gz。</p>
<p>用gz文件大小除以估计的真实文件大小，得到压缩比，发现压缩比和测序平台有关系，<font color="green"><strong>Miseq</strong>的压缩比在<strong>0.35</strong>左右，<strong>Hiseq</strong>平台中的panel测序在<strong>0.24</strong>左右，<strong>WES</strong>在<strong>0.2</strong>左右</font>。可以发现WES的数据的压缩效率最高，猜测不同平台在压缩过程中设置的压缩比例不同。Hiseq测序平台的gz文件压缩性能大于Miseq平台。</p>
<ul>
<li><p>以Miseq的gzip文件大小和数据量<strong>作图</strong>，可以很直观的发现gz文件大小和数据量之间的线性关系。斜率是1.245，截距可以忽略不计，因为纵坐标很大。也就是说R1文件的数据量约等于gzip文件的1.245倍。</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>从另外一个角度计算</strong>，<font color="green"><strong>R1文件数据量=gzip文件大小/压缩效率/2.3</strong></font>，则因为Miseq的压缩效率在0.35，Hiseq在0.23左右，所以Miseq R1文件的数据量大概是gzip文件的<font color="green">1.242倍（1/0.35/2.3）</font>，和上图拟合的结果很相近，<strong>Hiseq约在1.89(1/0.23/2.3)倍</strong>。真实的数据量其实是R1文件数据量的2倍（R2文件中的数据量和R1文件相同）。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>结论：</strong>不同平台和不同测序方法之间的<font color="green">fastq文件压缩比例并不一致</font>，但同一种方法和平台内的压缩比例是相近的，因而可以根据gzip文件的大小推测出测序的数据量。</p>
<p><strong>Miseq的测序量约是R1 gzip文件大小的2.49倍(R1+R2)，Hiseq的测序量约是R1 gzip文件大小的3.78倍。</strong>不同平台和方法之间，这个值是不固定的，可以根据手头的数据计算一下这个比例，就能迅速的估算出样本的数据量。</p>

<p><em><strong>b.</strong></em>  raw reads 或预修正reads被存储，de Bruijn graph data structure 被用于表示reads间overlap。</p>
<p>Kmer-graph构建：所有reads被切割成某一固定Kmer长度的序列（21bp=&lt;kmer&lt;=127bp），形成等长的Kmers。将Kmers连成图。<font color="green"><strong>相邻的kmers是通过K-1 overlaping连接</strong></font>，所以它不需要成对序列比对（The neighboring kmers are K-1 overlaping which generated from read sequences, so it doesn’t need pair-wise reads alignment.）。重复序列在图中被压缩。</p>

<h1 id="简介"><a href="#简介" class="headerlink" title="简介"></a>简介</h1><p>SOAPdenovo（目前最新版是SOAPdenovo2）是利用一种新的组装短read的方法，它以kerm为节点单位，利用<font color="green"><strong>de Bruijn图</strong></font>的方法实现全基因组的组装，和其他短序列组装软件相比，它可以进行大型基因组比如人类基因组的组装，组装结果更加准确可靠，可以通过组装的结果非常准确地鉴别出基因组上的序列结构性变异，为构建全基因组参考序列和以低测序成本对未知基因组实施精确分析创造了可能。</p>
<p>SOAPdenovo aims for large plant and animal genomes, although it also works well on bacteria and fungi genomes. It runs on 64-bit Linux system with a minimum of 5G physical memory. For <strong>big genomes</strong> like human, about <strong>150 GB memory</strong> would be required.</p>

<p><strong>对于SOAPdenovo的每个步骤都有日志文件输出，要保存好日志文件，日志文件中包含有很多有用的信息。</strong></p>
<p>SOAPdenovo日志输出说明：</p>
<p>1）<font color="red">pregraph.log</font>:  其中有很多的统计信息，包括构建debruijn-graph所用reads数目，构图产生多少uniq的kmer以及设置-d参数后去除了多少kmer。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-R            利用read鉴别短的重复序列，默认值不进行此操作</p>
<p>-d    INT     去除频数不大于该值的k-mer，默认值为0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>在pregraph中，可选参数有 –R –K –d  结果如：<br>5467781332 <strong>nodes</strong> allocated, 70662750348 <strong>kmer</strong> <strong>in reads</strong>, 70662750348 <strong>kmer processed</strong><br>3283081670 <strong>kmer removed</strong><br>其中Kmer 数取决于k值和数据量，nodes数即特异性kmer数，当nodes数目过高<strong>（一般和基因组大小差不多大小），可能是数据的错误率比较高，也可能是存在杂合</strong>。若nodes数目偏小，且kmer数目多，则基因组重复度较高。</p>
<p>k值的选取，当数据量充足（&gt;=40X），<strong>植物基因组一般采用大kmer效果较好</strong>，而<strong>动物基因组k值一般取27和29足够</strong>。kmer removed表示的 <strong>–d 参数所去除的低频的kmer</strong>。</p>
<p>2）<font color="red">contig.log</font>: contig 中，可选参数 –R –D –M，注，-R 参数的选定，必须pregraph和contig中同时选择才有效。</p>

<h1 id="参数调整"><a href="#参数调整" class="headerlink" title="参数调整"></a>参数调整</h1><p>组装时需调整的参数，主要分两种：</p>
<p>一种是脚本中参数改动：如调整  -K  -R  -d  -D  -M<br>-K 值一般与基因组的特性和数据量相关，目前用到的SOAPdenovo软件主要有两个版本，SOAPdenovo-63mer是可使用大kmer组装，K值范围13-63。<br>【<strong>经验</strong>】：植物基因组组装采用大kmer效果会比较好（要求短片段reads长度75bp），动物基因组很少有用到大kmer后有明显改进效果的，且<strong>动物基因组组装K值一般设置为27和29较多</strong>。</p>
<p><font color="red"><strong>组装杂合子基因组的K-mer值应该小一点；组装含有高repeats基因组且要求其有高的测序深度和长的reads,的K-mer应该大一点。</strong></font></p>
<p>-R参数，对于<font color="green">动物基因组R参数一般不设置</font>，<font color="red"><strong>植物基因组</strong>由于<strong>较多的repeat区</strong>则<strong>设置R参数</strong>后效果更好</font>。注意<strong>设置-R时，一般使用-M 的默认值</strong>。（熊猫基因组组装时得出的结论）</p>
<p>-M 参数，0-3,<strong>默认值1</strong>。一般杂合率为千分之几就设为几。熊猫基因组组装时-M 2 。</p>
<p>-d 参数，对于没有纠错，没有处理的质量又较差的原始数据，kmer频数为1数据较多的组装，<font color="red"><strong>设置为-d 1 足够</strong></font>。对于处理过或是测序质量较好数据可不设置。数据量较多时，也可设置-d 去除部分质量稍差数据。</p>
<p>-D 参数，默认为1，一般不用另行设置。</p>
<p>第二种，从<strong>map</strong>过程去调节参数。可以<font color="red"> 调整配置文件map_len的值和调整文件 * .peGrads  </font>。<br>当<strong>文库插入片段分布图</strong>中文库大小与<strong>实验给出的文库大小</strong><font color="red">差异很大</font>，<font color="red"><em><em>调整</em>.peGrad</em>*s</font>文件中的插入片段大小。</p>
<p>根据每一档数据的数据量去调整文库的<strong>rank等级</strong>。</p>
<p>当该文库的数据量很多或者是在构建scaffold的过程中的冲突数很多时，可是适当的调大第四列的<strong>pair_num_cutoff</strong>，把条件设置的更严。</p>
<h1 id="内存估计"><a href="#内存估计" class="headerlink" title="内存估计"></a>内存估计</h1><p>SOAPdenovo四个步骤消耗的内存不一样</p>
<p>第一步消耗内存最多，使用没有纠错的的reads，(<font color="blue"> <strong>K&lt;=31**</strong></font>)第一步消耗的内存在<font color="blue"><strong>基因组大小80－100倍</strong>左右</font>，<font color="blue">纠过错在40－50倍**左右</font></p>
<p>第二步相对消耗内存会少很多</p>
<p>第三步消耗内存仅次于第一步，在第一步的一半左右</p>
<p>第四步消耗的内存也会比较少</p>
<p>对于CPU的使用，默认是8个，如果申请内存时申请一个计算节点的所有内存, CPU就设置为该计算节点的CPU个数充分利用计算资源，如果仅申请一个节点的部分内存则根据实际情况考虑。</p>
<p>对于<font color="blue"><strong>大kemr(K&gt;31)</strong></font>其内存使用是<font color="blue">**(k&lt;=31)**</font>的<font color="blue"><strong>1.5倍</strong></font>左右，有时甚至更多，要充分估计内存使用，在第一次运行时考虑不能太保守。</p>
<h1 id="常见错误"><a href="#常见错误" class="headerlink" title="常见错误"></a>常见错误</h1><p>1）配置文件reads存储路径错误<br>只输出日志文件。<br>pregraph.log中的错误信息：“Cannot open /path/LIBNAMEA/fastq_read_1.fq.

The configuration file: where? information? example.config</p>
<p>The configuration file has a section for <font color="red"><strong>global information</strong></font>, and then <font color="red"><strong>multiple library sections</strong></font>. Right now only “max_rd_len” is included in the global information section. Any read longer than max_rd_len will be cut to this length.</p>
<p>The library information and the information of sequencing data generated from the library should be organized in the corresponding library section. <font color="red"><strong>Each library section starts with tag [LIB]</strong></font> and includes the following items:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">-avg_ins</span><br><span class="line">-reverse_seq</span><br><span class="line">-asm_flags</span><br><span class="line">-rd_len_cutof</span><br><span class="line">-rank</span><br><span class="line">-pair_num_cutoff</span><br><span class="line">-map_len</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>



<p>The assembler accepts read file in three kinds of formats: <font color="green">FASTA, FASTQ and BAM</font>. Mate-pair relationship could be indicated in two ways: two sequence files with reads in the same order belonging to a pair, or two adjacent reads in a single file (FASTA only) belonging to a pair. If a read in <strong>bam</strong> file <strong>fails</strong> platform/vendor <strong>quality checks</strong>(the flag field 0x0200 is set), itself and it’s <strong>paired read</strong> would be <strong>ignored</strong>.</p>

<p>理想条件该图应该为一条平滑的曲线，有明确最大值。然而在一些情况下有多个局部最大值。</p>
<p>这些情况表明，对于某些k值，Kmergenie中的统计模型并不总是正确地拟合输入数据。因此由Kmergenie预测的最佳k值可能不是最佳的。在随后的分析中，还尝试使用比Kmergenie预测的k大的k(其他峰值)</p>
<p>若基因组k-mers的数量不会随着k值的升高而下降，则是一个高覆盖率(high coverage)数据集的迹象？<br>什么是覆盖率呢？<br>覆盖率(coverage)：指的是测序过程中读取单个碱基的平均次数。如果覆盖度为100×，说明平均每个碱基测序了100次。对碱基测序的频率越高，数据的质量越高。</p>

<h1 id="技术细节和使用"><a href="#技术细节和使用" class="headerlink" title="技术细节和使用"></a>技术细节和使用</h1><p>seqkit处理压缩文件</p>
<p>pigz 或者 gzip 在部分操作中不能加速，所以在v.0.8.1版本以便关注了，然而还是可以使用命令：</p>
<p>pigz -d -c seqs.fq.gz | seqkit xxx<br>因为seqkit使用了pgzip去写gzip。这比gzip和pigz更快。（10X of gzip, 4X of pigz），而且gzip压缩文件比较大。</p>
<p>从数据处理格式来讲</p>
<p>seqkit无缝支持fa和fq格式数据，并且可以自动识别。除了 faidx之外，全部命令都可以处理这两种格式的数据。</p>
<p>只有fa格式支持命令(subseq, split, sort和shuffle)利用FASTA索引(by flag -two-pass)下提高大文件的性能。</p>
<p>序列类型的检测DNA/RNA/Protein，会使用子序列进行，默认检测第一条子序列，通过—alphabet-guess-seq-length参数默认为10000，如果长度小于10000，则检查整条序列。</p>
<p>序列名字</p>
<p>所有的软件，包括seqkit，使用第一个空格之前的字符作为序列的名字：<br>需要注意的NCBI等一些序列的格式并不是如此，例如：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gi|110645304|ref|NC_002516.2| Pseudomona<br>想要在seqkit中识别出来的序列ID为：NC_002516.2。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>此时使用参数–id-regexp “|([^|]+)| “，或者添加参数–id-ncbi，但如果是只要前面的gi数字作为ID的话，添加参数：–id-regexp “^gi|([^|]+)|“。</p>
<p>注意：.seqkit.fai不同于samtools产生的.fai格式文件，seqkit使用整个序列开头而不是ID作为索引。</p>
<p>并行运算</p>
<p>单核CPU默认线程：—threads 1，多个CPU，线程默认2.</p>
<p>内存占用</p>
<p>seqkit许多的命令都不需要将整个序列读入到内存中。包括：stat, fq2fa, fx2tab, tab2fx, grep, locate, replace, seq, sliding, subseq。</p>
<p>注意：如果使用subseq —gtf | —bed时，如果GTF或者BED文件太大，内存使用量会暴增，可以通过指定染色体：—chr，或者—feature去限制特征。</p>
<p>有一些命令需要将文件读入内存，但是可以用过rmdup 和 common减少内存使用。</p>
<p>随机—抽样</p>
<p>抽样命令sample和shuffle使用了随机功能，为了保证重现性，可以使用-s设置随机种子。这可以保证在不同的环境中可以有相同的抽样结果。</p>

<li>Core意思是内存, Dump的意思是扔出来, 堆出来。在开发（或使用）一个程序时，有时程序莫名其妙的down了, 却没有任何提示(有时提示core dumped)。虽然系统没事，但下次仍可能遇到相同问题。这时可查看有无形如core.PID的core文件生成，这个文件便是操作系统把程序down掉时的内存内容扔出来生成的，让debugger 做参考。这个动作叫 core dump。<ul>
<li>core dump又叫<strong>核心转储</strong>, 当程序运行过程中发生异常, 程序异常退出时, 由操作系统把程序当前的内存状况存储在一个core文件中, 叫core dump。简而言之，<font color="red">进程异常终止，进程用户空间的数据就会被写到磁盘core文件</font>。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="为何有时程序Down了，却没生成-Core文件"><a href="#为何有时程序Down了，却没生成-Core文件" class="headerlink" title="为何有时程序Down了，却没生成 Core文件"></a>为何有时程序Down了，却没生成 Core文件</h2><ul>
<li><font color="red">有时候程序down了, 不像编译错误会提示到文件某一行，而是没有任何信息</font>。一种办法是用gdb的step（linux下调试工具gdb是很强大的调试器）, 一步一步寻找，但要step一个上万行的代码让人难以想象。 更好的办法就是core file。</li>
<li><font color="red">如果core文件没有生成</font>，是因为core.PID的core文件的生成跟当前系统的环境设置有关系，<font color="red">系统默认core文件的大小为0</font>（注意core file size (blocks, -c) 0 这行，表示分配给core文件的长度（单位为字节，一个块的大小要分系统而定了），为0肯定无core文件，可修改之）</li>
<li>用ulimit命令查看和修改core文件的大小，使用<code>ulimit -a</code>查看大小，使用 <code>ulimit -c unlimited</code>表示对core文件不做限制 或 使用<code>ulimit -c 1024</code> 对core文件分配1024个字节</li>
<li><font color="red">程序运行过程出现aborted(core dumped)，ulimit -a，结果确实 core file size (blocks, -c) 0，无法生成中断文件</font></li>
<li>若修改后再运行程序便生成<code>core.PID</code>的core文件（<strong>core文件生成的位置一般和运行程序的路径相同, 文件名一般为core.进程号</strong>）。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="如何使用core文件"><a href="#如何使用core文件" class="headerlink" title="如何使用core文件?"></a>如何使用core文件?</h2><ul>
<li>发生core dump后，使用gdb查看core文件内容, 以定位文件中引发core dump的行，在Linux下，查看core文件中的出错堆栈信息有二种方式，使用：<font color="red">gdb -c core.pid program_name</font>或gdb [program_name] [core.pid]可以进入gdb模式</li>
<li>在进入gdb后输入<font color="red">where并回车</font>，就可以指出是在哪一行被Down掉，在哪个函数内，由谁调用等等。</li>
<li>在进入gdb后输入<font color="red"> bt</font>，用bt命令查看backtrace以检查发生程序运行到哪里，来定位core dump的文件-&gt;行。</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="core-dump-原因"><a href="#core-dump-原因" class="headerlink" title="core dump 原因"></a>core dump 原因</h2><ul>
<li><p><font color="red">batch_size过大导致的。Aborted(core dumped)</font></p>
</li>
<li><p>线程被谋杀， 被谋杀者所在线程会抛出一个异常。Cancellation &amp; C++ Exception</p>
</li>
<li><p>pure virtual method called terminate called without an active exception 解决方案</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>对于多线程的程序，这个错误的主要原因是当前对象已经被销毁或者正在被销毁，但是其又在被调用，导致了冲突。</p>

<p>基因组杂合度和重复序列对后续基因组组装有很大影响。</p>
<p><strong>高杂合</strong>基因组往往无法合并姊妹染色体，导致组装结果<strong>偏大</strong>。</p>
<p>而<strong>重复序列</strong>在组装中被折叠，使组装中出现缺口、错误，导致组装结果<strong>偏小</strong>。</p>
<p>不同的生物基因组之间杂合率和重复序列含量差异巨大，因此在基因组测序前需要对基因组特征进行调研，以确定测序方案，周期等。</p>
<p>目前常用的调研手段有三种：</p>
<ol>
<li>用流式细胞仪测定细胞核内的<strong>DNA总量</strong></li>
<li>用核型分析方法，识别<strong>染色体数量、倍性</strong></li>
<li>用调研图，通过二代测序，估算<strong>基因组大小、杂合度、重复序列比例、GC含量</strong>等。</li>
</ol>
<p>不同技术手段不同侧重，其中<font color="red">调研图</font>以<font color="green">低成本，低难度和更多的评估内容</font>使用最多，同时<font color="red"><strong>Survey所测二代数据还可用于回比基因组，评估组装质量</strong></font>。调研图<font color="green">基于数学统计学手段</font>获取物种信息的方式，因此对于已经研究的较为清晰的物种——主要是<font color="green"><strong>普通二倍体和简单多倍体</strong></font>，其<font color="green">染色体条数、倍性、大概基因组大小是已知</font>，此时仅选择<strong>survey</strong>足以满足基因组特征需要，但对于<strong>多倍体复杂基因组</strong>更推荐<strong>补充核型分析和流式</strong>，以和调研图相互印证补充。</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Survey 方案</strong></p>
<p>通过质控、NT比对，获得高质量的clean data，为后续分析奠定良好基础；</p>
<p>基因组Survey基于小片段文库的低深度测序数据（50X）左右；</p>
<p>通过K-mer分析，有效的评估基因组大小、GC含量、杂合度以及重复序列的含量等信息；</p>
<p>全面了解某一物种基因组特征的有效方法；</p>
<p>为后续的全基因denove测序的组装策略的制定提供理论依据。</p>
<p><strong>分析内容</strong>：污染程度评估，基因组大小评估，杂合度评估，重复率评估，GC含量评估。【初步了解三代组装难度和预期大小】</p>
<p><strong>基因组复杂度预估?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>普通基因组的定义？<br>单倍体、纯合二倍体或者杂合度&lt;0.5%，且重复序列含量&lt;50%，GC含量为35%到65%之间的二倍体。</p>
<p>复杂基因组的定义？<br>杂合度&gt;0.5%，重复序列含量&gt;50%，多倍体，GC含量处于异常的范围（GC含量&lt;35%或者GC含量&gt;65%的二倍体）。</p>
<p><font color="red">二倍体复杂基因组进一步细分为</font><br><font color="red"> 微杂合基因组（0.5%&lt;杂合率&lt;=0.8%)</font><br><font color="red"> 高杂合基因组（杂合率&gt;0.8%)</font><br> <font color="red">高重复基因组（重复序列比例&gt;50%）</font></p>
<p>基因组大小：<br> 基因组越大，测序花钱越多</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>简单基因组: 杂合度低于0.5%, GC含量在35%~65%, 重复序列低于50%</li>
<li>二倍体普通基因组: 杂合度在0.5%~1.2%中间，重复序列低于50%。或杂合度低于0.5%，重复序列低于65%</li>

<h1 id="k-mers"><a href="#k-mers" class="headerlink" title="k-mers"></a>k-mers</h1><p>最简单的策略就是基于k-mer对基因组做一个简单的了解, 使用jellyfish统计k-mers，然后作图</p>

<p>用R作图</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">pdf(&quot;21_mer.out.pdf&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">dataframe19 &lt;- read.table(&quot;21mer_out.histo&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">plot(dataframe19[1:200,], type=&quot;l&quot;)</span><br><span class="line">dev.off()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>由于只有一个主峰，说明该物种的杂合度并不高，基本上也就是二倍体。如果图中出现多个峰，说明它可能是多倍体或者是基因组杂合度高。</p>
<p>推荐文献: Genomic DNA k-mer spectra: models and modalities</p>
<h1 id="基于组装"><a href="#基于组装" class="headerlink" title="基于组装"></a>基于组装</h1><p>基于K-mers可以较好的预测基因组大小，并定性的了解基因组的复杂情况，如果想更具体的了解基因组的复杂度，可以先将50X以上的段片段进行组装，然后进行分析。</p>
<p>组装的工具比较多，推荐用SOAPdenovo，因为速度快。abyss?</p>
<p>新建一个contig.config, 增加如下内容</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">max_rd_len=150</span><br><span class="line">[LIB]</span><br><span class="line">avg_ins=200</span><br><span class="line">reverse_seq=0</span><br><span class="line">asm_flags=3</span><br><span class="line">rd_len_cutoff=100</span><br><span class="line">rank=1</span><br><span class="line">pair_num_cutoff=3</span><br><span class="line">map_len=32</span><br><span class="line">q1=read_1.fq</span><br><span class="line">q2=read_2.fq</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>组装出参考序列</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">~/opt/biosoft/SOAPdenovo2/SOAPdenovo-63mer all -s contig.config -R -K 63 -p 30 -o assembly/graph</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>最后graph.scafSeq是拼接后的序列, 提取出大于300bp的序列.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># adjust format</span><br><span class="line">bioawk -c fastx -v name=1 &#x27;&#123;if(length($seq)&gt;300) print &quot;&gt;&quot;name &quot;\n&quot; $seq;name+=1&#125;&#x27; assembly/graph.scafSeq &gt;contig.fa</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h1 id="杂合度估计"><a href="#杂合度估计" class="headerlink" title="杂合度估计"></a>杂合度估计</h1><p>将原来的序列回贴到contig上，并用samtools+bcftools进行snp calling.统计变异的碱基占总体的比例。</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkdir -p index</span><br><span class="line">bwa index contig.fa -p index/contig</span><br><span class="line">bwa mem -v 2 -t 10 index/contig read_1.fq read_2.fq | samtools sort -n &gt; align.bam</span><br><span class="line">samtools mpileup -f contig align.bam | bcftools call -mv -Oz -o variants.gz</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>一方面由于SOAPdenovo组装过程中会出错, 另一方面samtools在变异检测上也存在很高的假阳性, 所以总得先按照深度和质量过滤一批假阳性。</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">bcftools view -i &#x27; DP &gt; 30 &amp;&amp; MQ &gt; 30&#x27; -H variants.vcf.gz | wc -l</span><br><span class="line"># 325219, 无过滤是445113</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>变异数目占基因组大小的比例就是杂合度。我的contig大概是200M，找到0.3M左右的变异，也就是0.0015，即0.15%.</p>
<h1 id="重复序列估计"><a href="#重复序列估计" class="headerlink" title="重复序列估计"></a>重复序列估计</h1><p>基于同源注释，用RepeatMasker寻找重复序列. 这里要注意分析的fasta的ID不能过长，也就是最好是<code>&gt;scaffold_1</code>这种形式，不然会报错。</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">~/opt/biosoft/RepeatMsker/RepeatMasker -e ncbi -species arabidopsis -pa 10 -gff -dir ./ contig.fa</span><br><span class="line"># -e ncbi</span><br><span class="line"># -species 选择物种 用~/opt/biosoft/RepeatMasker/util/queryRepeatDatabase.pl -tree 了解</span><br><span class="line"># -pa 并行计算</span><br><span class="line"># -gff 输出gff注释</span><br><span class="line"># -dir 输出路径</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>输出结果中主要关注如下三个</p>
<ul>
<li>output.fa.masked, 将重复序列用N代替</li>
<li>output.fa.out.gff, 以gff2形式存放重复序列出现的位置</li>
<li>output.fa.tbl, 该文件记录着分类信息</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">==================================================</span><br><span class="line">file name: anno.fasta</span><br><span class="line">sequences:         62027</span><br><span class="line">total length:  273135210 bp  (273135210 bp excl N/X-runs)</span><br><span class="line">GC level:         36.80 %</span><br><span class="line">bases masked:   79642191 bp ( 29.16 %)</span><br><span class="line">==================================================</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>也就是说我们的物种有30%的重复序列，作为参考，拟南芥125Mb 14%重复序列, 水稻389M，36%重复</p>

<p>我国大豆消费对外依赖严重，而提高大豆产量则必须对大豆种质的遗传多样性进行综合评价。中科院遗传与发育生物学研究所等单位与贝瑞基因合作，利用最新组装策略构建了高质量的基于图形的泛基因组。该研究利用Illumina平台对来自世界大豆主产国的2,898份大豆种质进行重测序（13×），利用PacBio（96×）、Bionano和Hi-C技术对26份代表性种质进行基因组组装和泛基因组构建。并以ZH13基因组为基准基因组，整合PAVs后构建基于基因组图谱。将重测序数据重新比对到该基因组进行SVs检测和GWAS分析。在开花的主效位点<em>E3</em>发现了5种不同的单倍型；种皮颜色相关基因<em>CHS</em>的<em>I</em>位点发现5种主要单倍型；14号染色体上的缺铁褪绿症QTL内存在一个调控Fe2+/Zn2+转运蛋白基因<em>SoyZH13_14G179600</em>。</p>

<li><p>The <code>-C</code> switch instructs to save in the hash only canonical规范 k-mers, while the count is the number of occurrences of both a k-mer and it reverse complement.</p>
</li>
<li><p><font color="green"><strong>-s</strong></font> 预估值设置：The size parameter (given with <font color="red">-s</font>) is an indication of <font color="red">the number k-mers [N*(L-K+1)]</font> that will be <font color="red"><strong>stored in the hash</strong></font>. For sequencing reads, this size should be the size of <font color="red">the genome plus the k-mers generated by sequencing errors</font>. For example, if the error rate is <font color="red">e</font> (e.g.Illumina reads, usually e~<font color="red">1%</font>), with an estimated genome size of G and a coverage of <font color="red">c</font>, the number of expected k-mers is <font color="red"><strong>G+Gcek</strong></font>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: unlike in Jellyfish 1, this <code>-s</code> parameter is <font color="red">only an estimation</font>. <font color="red">If the size given is too small to fit all the k-mers, the hash size will be increased automatically or partial results will be written to disk and finally merged automatically</font>. Running <code>jellyfish merge</code> should never be necessary, as now jellyfish now takes care of this task on its own. </p>

<li>If the low frequency k-mers (k-mers occurring only once), which are mostly due to sequencing errors, are not of interest, one might consider counting only high-frequency k-mers (see section <a href="https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish/tree/master/doc#Counting-high-frequency-k-mers">Counting high frequency k-mers</a>), which uses less memory and is potentially faster. <font color="green"><strong>低频k-mers由测序错误导致，只考虑高频减少内存使用提高速度</strong></font>。</li>

<li>If k is large enough so that each kmer found is unique in the genome,</li>
<li>and if the genome length (e.g. 1,000,000) is much larger than the kmer length (e.g. 21),</li>
<li>and if no PCR or sequencing errors,</li>
<li>then the number of kmers will be approximately equal to the length of the genome.</li>

<p>Note: Aug 2019: conda install seems to work only with: conda install jellyfish=2.2.3</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="green">“&gt;Go through</font> the sequencing reads</li>
<li>For each <font color="green">new kmer seen</font>, <font color="green">add to table with count</font>.</li>
<li>If kmer <font color="green">seen before</font>, <font color="green">increment count</font>.</li>
<li>Find the <font color="green">average kmer frequency</font> (sequencing depth), e.g. 50</li>
<li><font color="green">Exclude kmers with a count of ~ 1</font>, as these are likely from <font color="green">errors</font></li>
<li>Add all the other kmers, and <font color="green"><strong>divide by average kmer frequency</strong></font> =&gt; This is the approx genome length</li>

<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-2-SMRT/12.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>由于测序小孔直径很小，激发光的穿透能力会逐渐衰减，只能在小孔中传输很短的距离，所以<font color="green">只有当dNTP足够靠近底部，荧光基团才会被激发光照到，发出荧光</font>。其他游离dNTP虽然也有可能飘到小孔底部被激发光照到，但这种情况极少。<br>在一个碱基合成结束后，带有荧光基团的磷酸基团会从dNTP上掉落，发生猝灭，不影响其他碱基的信号检测。 在发生测序的小孔有各自的DNA片段和测序复合物，同一时间发出不同颜色的激发光，机器会检测到如下的光信号，实际同时会得到多达几万个光点。</p>

Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) – HiFi"></a>1. Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) – HiFi</h2><p>说这种测序模型前，就不得不提三代测序最大的缺点：<font color="green">碱基读取不准，错误率在12.5%</font>。每八个碱基读错一个。</p>
<p>碱基读取<font color="green">错误随机</font>，重读一遍同样位置的碱基，不一定发生相同错误。</p>
<p>对同一个序列，多测几遍，<font color="red">矫正</font>读错碱基。</p>
<p>滚环复制的优势: 利用测序复合物在<font color="red">环状文库分子循环测序</font><strong>同一个片段</strong>来<font color="green">消除错误率</font>。</p>
<p>HiFi reads（High Fidelity reads）是2019年由PacBio推出的基于<font color="red">环化共有序列（Circular Consensus Sequencing，CCS）</font>模式产生的既兼顾长读长（<font color="red">10-20kb</font>长度）又具有高精度（&gt;99%准确率）的测序结果。</p>
<p>超长酶读长中，去掉接头序列，即可获得多条subreads。多条subreads合并生成高度一致性的hifi reads。</p>
<p><video src="2022-02-20-SMRT-sequencing/14.mp4"></video><br>这种测序模型，复制出的 Reads叫 <font color="red">HiFi Reads [High fidelity reads]</font>，测序准确率 &gt; 99%。</p>
<p>HiFi reads are a <strong>type of data produced using the circular consensus sequencing (CCS) mode on one of the PacBio Sequel Systems</strong>.</p>
<p>HiFi reads（High fidelity reads）是 <font color="red">Sequel II</font>三代测序平台推出的兼顾长读长和高准确度的测序序列，一般采用CCS（Circular Consensus Sequencing）模式测序。</p>
<p>在单次测序中得到更多的HiFi reads往往需要<strong>平衡</strong>测序的 <font color="red">酶读长</font>和 <font color="red">插入片段的长度</font>，插入片段太长会导致酶无法进行滚环测序，插入片段太短又牺牲了三代长读长测序的优势。</p>
<p>根据前期的官方经验推荐，目前HiFi文库构建的<font color="red">插入片段一般为8-13 kb</font>左右。安诺优达构建约10 kb的HiFi文库在<font color="red">Sequel II</font>平台进行测序。原始下机数据单cell产出268 Gb数据，其中<font color="red">酶平均读长51 kb</font>，<font color="red">酶读长N50 124 kb</font>，<font color="red">subreads平均读长11 kb</font>，<font color="red">subreads N50 13 kb</font>。</p>

<p>进一步利用官方软件调取CCS，设置最小pass数为3，经过调取获得CCS总数据量为<strong>22.43 Gb</strong>，CCS 序列数目为<strong>172.5万</strong>条<strong>，平均长度</strong>13 kb<strong>。与下机总数据量相比，</strong>目前CCS reads的得率约为8%，并且能够兼顾reads的读长，达到平均13 kb左右，数据质量相当不错??</p>

<p>对拿到的HiFi reads进行进一步的<font color="red">质量评估</font>，我们发现大部分HiFi reads的<font color="red">准确度?</font>都在0.95以上，其中约35%的reads（pass≥10）质量值达到QV30（99.9%），这样高质量的reads非常有助于研究者开展下游深入的研究。</p>

<p>同时兼顾长读长和高准确度的HiFi reads究竟有何用处呢？2019年<em>BioRxiv</em>题为“<strong>Highly-accurate long-read sequencing improves variant detection and assembly of a human genome</strong>”的文章。在这篇文章里研究者利用约30X的CCS reads组装人基因组，通过<font color="green">FALCON、Canu3和 wtdbg2</font>等不同软件进行组装，<font color="red">contig N50达到15.43-28.95 Mb</font>。从组装连续性来看，<strong>CCS reads能够做到与<font color="red">传统的CLR reads</font>组装相当的结果，重要的是基因组碱基准确度得到了明显提升，基因组组装消耗的计算资源和时间大幅下降</strong>。进一步利用CCS reads进行<font color="red">SNP、InDel等变异检测</font>，发现CCS reads在小的变异检出率和准确度上都有显著提升，数据结果与30X的Illumina数据分析结果基本接近。</p>
<ul>
<li>文章中CCS reads进行SNV和InDel calling统计表</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/./18.png" alt="1562200919110586.png"></p>
<p>综上，HiFi reads无论在<font color="red">基因组全变异检测（SNV、InDel、SV）</font>还是<font color="red">基因组<em>de novo</em></font>领域都适用。目前<font color="red">唯一的限制因素</font>是要获得足够的HiFi reads，测序成本投入比较<font color="red">昂贵</font>，从组装<strong>计算资源节省</strong>和<strong>项目时间缩短</strong>的角度看，HiFi reads未尝不是更好的选择。<strong>对于基因组<font color="red">重复序列较多的复杂基因组</font>，目前市场上<font color="red">传统长读长测序准确度不高</font>的特点给组装造成了一定的困难，高准确度的HiFi reads未来可能是一个更好的解决方案。</strong>而对于昆虫、中草药、藻类等重复序列较高、基因组较小的物种（＜700 Mb），目前利用一个8 M SMRT Cell 产出的数据量基本足以支持CCS组装，性价比更高。需要完善的HiFi文库建库流程和基于CCS reads组装的生信流程！</p>

<p>什么是 GC bias？<br>PCR 时，如果模板里的<font color="red">G、C碱基含量高，PCR效率低</font>，A、T碱基含量高，PCR效率高。一般测序过程，如二代测序，都会有大量的PCR过程。这样就会有一个问题，<font color="red">G、C含量高的片段，读到的 Reads 数少</font>。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SMRT 没有 PCR ，因此GC含量高低的 Reads 片段都会有相似的概率被测序， GC Bias 影响小。</p>
<h2 id="2-读长的限制因素"><a href="#2-读长的限制因素" class="headerlink" title="2. 读长的限制因素"></a>2. 读长的限制因素</h2><ul>
<li><strong>DNA模板断裂</strong>，用激发光长时间照射DNA链时，会发生断裂，DNA链会从酶上掉下来，测序终止。</li>
<li><strong>酶变性</strong>，酶被长时间照射时，酶会变性，失去聚合酶活性，测序终止。</li>

<p>目前，主流的测序平台有三种，各有利弊，可以根据自己的课题来选择。</p>
<p>以RSII为例，将测序复合物，随机撒到15万个小孔中，正好有一个<font color="red">复合物进入到单个小孔的概率符合泊松分布</font>。理论情况是</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 的小孔中有<font color="red">一个</font>测序复合物，正常信号</li>
<li>1/3 的小孔什么都<font color="red">没有</font>，无信号</li>
<li>1/3 的小孔中有<font color="red">两个以上的测序复合物</font>，杂乱信号</li>

<p>五万个小孔 * 10kb，所以一张芯片大约会产出500M的数据。</p>

<li>无fastq文件，sequel平台中bam 文件成为了fq的替代者，更节约储存空间。这是文件格式的一个重大更新。</li>

<h1 id="关键点"><a href="#关键点" class="headerlink" title="关键点"></a>关键点</h1><p>第一：<font color="green">显微镜</font>实时记录DNA链荧光时，<font color="green">DNA链周围众多荧光标记脱氧核苷酸</font>形成非常强大的<font color="green">荧光背景</font>。强大荧光背景阻碍单分子荧光探测。Pacific Biosciences公司发明了一种<font color="green">直径只有几十纳米的纳米孔</font>[zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs)]，单分子的<font color="green">DNA聚合酶</font>被固定在孔内。在小孔内，DNA链<font color="green">周围荧光标记</font>的脱氧核苷酸<font color="green">有限</font>，而且由于A，T，C，G这四种荧光标记的脱氧核苷酸非常快速地从外面进入到孔内又出去，形成了非常<font color="green">稳定的背景荧光信号</font>。当某一种荧光标记的脱氧核苷酸被掺入到DNA链时，特定颜色的<font color="green">荧光会持续一小段时间</font>，直到新的化学键形成，荧光基团被DNA聚合酶切除为止。</p>
<p>第二：<font color="green">共聚焦显微镜</font>实时快速地对集成在<font color="green">板上的无数纳米小孔同时记录</font>。</p>
<h1 id="技术特点"><a href="#技术特点" class="headerlink" title="技术特点"></a>技术特点</h1><p>1、实现DNA聚合酶内在自身的<font color="green">反应速度</font>，一秒测10个碱基，测序速度是<font color="green">化学法测序2万倍</font>。</p>
<p>2、实现了DNA聚合酶内在自身的<font color="green">延续性</font>，一个反应可测非常长的序列。二代测序可以测到上百个碱基，但是三代测序可测几千个碱基。</p>

<p>4、直接测<font color="green">RNA序列</font> (<strong>ISO</strong>)。既然<font color="green">DNA聚合酶</font>能够实时观测，那么以RNA为模板复制<font color="green">DNA的逆转录酶</font>也同样可以。RNA直接测序，将大大降低体外逆转录产生的系统误差。</p>

<h1 id="第一代测序"><a href="#第一代测序" class="headerlink" title="第一代测序"></a>第一代测序</h1><p>第一代DNA测序技术用的是1975年由桑格（Sanger）和考尔森（Coulson）开创的链终止法或者是1976-1977年由马克西姆（Maxam）和吉尔伯特（Gilbert）发明的化学法（链降解）. 并在1977年，桑格测定了第一个基因组序列，是噬菌体X174的，全长5375个碱基1。自此，人类获得了窥探生命遗传差异本质的能力，并以此为开端步入基因组学时代。研究人员在Sanger法的多年实践之中不断对其进行改进。在2001年，完成的首个人类基因组图谱就是以改进了的Sanger法为其测序基础，Sanger法核心原理是：由于ddNTP的2’和3’都不含羟基，其在DNA的合成过程中不能形成磷酸二酯键，因此可以用来中断DNA合成反应，在4个DNA合成反应体系中分别加入一定比例带有放射性同位素标记的ddNTP（分为：ddATP,ddCTP,ddGTP和ddTTP），通过凝胶电泳和放射自显影后可以根据电泳带的位置确定待测分子的DNA序列（图2）。这个<a href="http://smcg.cifn.unam.mx/enp-unam/03-EstructuraDelGenoma/animaciones/secuencia.swf">网址</a>为sanger测序法制作了一个小短片，形象而生动。</p>
<p>　　值得注意的是，就在测序技术起步发展的这一时期中，除了Sanger法之外还出现了一些其他的测序技术，如焦磷酸测序法、链接酶法等。其中，焦磷酸测序法是后来Roche公司454技术所使用的测序方法2–4，而连接酶测序法是后来ABI公司SOLID技术使用的测序方法2,4，但他们的共同核心手段都是利用了Sanger1中的可中断DNA合成反应的dNTP。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/2.png" alt="img"></p>
<h1 id="第二代测序"><a href="#第二代测序" class="headerlink" title="第二代测序"></a>第二代测序</h1><p>总的说来，第一代测序技术的主要特点是测序读长可达1000bp，准确性高达99.999%，但其测序成本高，通量低等方面的缺点，严重影响了其真正大规模的应用。因而第一代测序技术并不是最理想的测序方法。经过不断的技术开发和改进，以Roche公司的454技术、illumina公司的Solexa，Hiseq技术和ABI公司的Solid技术为标记的第二代测序技术诞生了。第二代测序技术大大降低了测序成本的同时，还大幅提高了测序速度，并且保持了高准确性，以前完成一个人类基因组的测序需要3年时间，而使用二代测序技术则仅仅需要1周，但在序列读长方面比起第一代测序技术则要短很多。表1和图3对第一代和第二代测序技术各自的特点以及测序成本作了一个简单的比较5，以下我将对这三种主要的第二代测序技术的主要原理和特点作一个简单的介绍。 </p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/3.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="Illumina"><a href="#Illumina" class="headerlink" title="Illumina"></a>Illumina</h2><p>　　Illumina公司的Solexa和Hiseq应该说是目前全球使用量最大的第二代测序机器，这两个系列的技术核心原理是相同的2,4。这两个系列的机器采用的都是边合成边测序的方法，它的测序过程主要分为以下4步，如图4.</p>
<p>​     （1）DNA待测文库构建</p>
<p>　　利用超声波把待测的DNA样本打断成小片段，目前除了组装之外和一些其他的特殊要求之外，主要是打断成200-500bp长的序列片段，并在这些小片段的两端添加上不同的接头，构建出单链DNA文库。</p>
<p>​     （2）Flowcell</p>
<p>　　Flowcell是用于吸附流动DNA片段的槽道，当文库建好后，这些文库中的DNA在通过flowcell的时候会随机附着在flowcell表面的channel上。每个Flowcell有8个channel，每个channel的表面都附有很多接头，这些接头能和建库过程中加在DNA片段两端的接头相互配对（这就是为什么flowcell能吸附建库后的DNA的原因），并能支持DNA在其表面进行桥式PCR的扩增。</p>
<p>​     （3）桥式PCR扩增与变性</p>
<p>　　桥式PCR以Flowcell表面所固定的接头为模板，进行桥形扩增，如图4.a所示。经过不断的扩增和变性循环，最终每个DNA片段都将在各自的位置上集中成束，每一个束都含有单个DNA模板的很多分拷贝，进行这一过程的目的在于实现将碱基的信号强度放大，以达到测序所需的信号要求。 </p>
<p>（4）测序</p>
<p>　　测序方法采用边合成边测序的方法。向反应体系中同时添加DNA聚合酶、接头引物和带有碱基特异荧光标记的4中dNTP（如同Sanger测序法）。这些dNTP的3’-OH被化学方法所保护，因而每次只能添加一个dNTP。在dNTP被添加到合成链上后，所有未使用的游离dNTP和DNA聚合酶会被洗脱掉。接着，再加入激发荧光所需的缓冲液，用激光激发荧光信号，并有光学设备完成荧光信号的记录，最后利用计算机分析将光学信号转化为测序碱基。这样荧光信号记录完成后，再加入化学试剂淬灭荧光信号并去除dNTP 3’-OH保护基团，以便能进行下一轮的测序反应。Illumina的这种测序技术每次只添加一个dNTP的特点能够很好的地解决同聚物长度的准确测量问题，它的主要测序错误来源是碱基的替换，目前它的测序错误率在1%-1.5%之间，测序周期以人类基因组重测序为例，30x测序深度大约为1周。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/4.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/5.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2 id="Roche-454"><a href="#Roche-454" class="headerlink" title="Roche 454"></a>Roche 454</h2><p>Roche 454测序系统是第一个商业化运营二代测序技术的平台。它的主要测序原理是（图5 abc）2：</p>
<p>（1）DNA文库制备</p>
<p>　　454测序系统的文件构建方式和illumina的不同，它是利用喷雾法将待测DNA打断成300-800bp长的小片段，并在片段两端加上不同的接头，或将待测DNA变性后用杂交引物进行PCR扩增，连接载体，构建单链DNA文库（图5a）。</p>
<p>（2）Emulsion PCR （乳液PCR，其实是一个注水到油的独特过程）</p>
<p>454当然DNA扩增过程也和illumina的截然不同，它将这些单链DNA结合在水油包被的直径约28um的磁珠上，并在其上面孵育、退火。</p>
<p>　　乳液PCR最大的特点是可以形成数目庞大的独立反应空间以进行DNA扩增。其关键技术是“注水到油”（水包油），基本过程是在PCR反应前，将包含PCR所有反应成分的水溶液注入到高速旋转的矿物油表面，水溶液瞬间形成无数个被矿物油包裹的小水滴。这些小水滴就构成了独立的PCR反应空间。理想状态下，每个小水滴只含一个DNA模板和一个磁珠。</p>
<p>　　这些被小水滴包被的磁珠表面含有与接头互补的DNA序列，因此这些单链DNA序列能够特异地结合在磁珠上。同时孵育体系中含有PCR反应试剂，所以保证了每个与磁珠结合的小片段都能独立进行PCR扩增，并且扩增产物仍可以结合到磁珠上。当反应完成后，可以破坏孵育体系并将带有DNA的磁珠富集下来。进过扩增，每个小片段都将被扩增约100万倍，从而达到下一步测序所要求的DNA量。</p>
<p>（3）焦磷酸测序</p>
<p>　　测序前需要先用一种聚合酶和单链结合蛋白处理带有DNA的磁珠，接着将磁珠放在一种PTP平板上。这种平板上特制有许多直径约为44um的小孔，每个小孔仅能容纳一个磁珠，通过这种方法来固定每个磁珠的位置，以便检测接下来的测序反应过程。　　</p>
<p>　　测序方法采用焦磷酸测序法，将一种比PTP板上小孔直径更小的磁珠放入小孔中，启动测序反应。测序反应以磁珠上大量扩增出的单链DNA为模板，每次反应加入一种dNTP进行合成反应。如果dNTP能与待测序列配对，则会在合成后释放焦磷酸基团。释放的焦磷酸基团会与反应体系中的ATP硫酸化学酶反应生成ATP。生成的ATP和荧光素酶共同氧化使测序反应中的荧光素分子并发出荧光，同时由PTP板另一侧的CCD照相机记录，最后通过计算机进行光信号处理而获得最终的测序结果。由于每一种dNTP在反应中产生的荧光颜色不同，因此可以根据荧光的颜色来判断被测分子的序列。反应结束后，游离的dNTP会在双磷酸酶的作用下降解ATP，从而导致荧光淬灭，以便使测序反应进入下一个循环。由于454测序技术中，每个测序反应都在PTP板上独立的小孔中进行，因而能大大降低相互间的干扰和测序偏差。454技术最大的优势在于其能获得较长的测序读长，当前454技术的平均读长可达400bp，并且454技术和illumina的Solexa和Hiseq技术不同，它最主要的一个缺点是无法准确测量同聚物的长度，如当序列中存在类似于PolyA的情况时，测序反应会一次加入多个T，而所加入的T的个数只能通过荧光强度推测获得，这就有可能导致结果不准确。也正是由于这一原因，454技术会在测序过程中引入插入和缺失的测序错误。 </p>

<h2 id="Solid技术"><a href="#Solid技术" class="headerlink" title="Solid技术"></a>Solid技术</h2><p>Solid测序技术是ABI公司于2007年开始投入用于商业测序应用的仪器。它基于连接酶法，即利用DNA连接酶在连接过程之中测序（图6）2,4。它的原理是：</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/9.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>　（1）DNA文库构建</p>
<p>​              　　片段打断并在片段两端加上测序接头，连接载体，构建单链DNA文库。</p>
<p>​           （2）Emulsion PCR</p>
<p>　　Solid的PCR过程也和454的方法类似，同样采用小水滴emulsion PCR，但这些微珠比起454系统来说则要小得多，只有1um。在扩增的同时对扩增产物的3’端进行修饰，这是为下一步的测序过程作的准备。3’修饰的微珠会被沉积在一块玻片上。在微珠上样的过程中，沉积小室将每张玻片分成1个、4个或8个测序区域（图6-a）。Solid系统最大的优点就是每张玻片能容纳比454更高密度的微珠，在同一系统中轻松实现更高的通量。</p>
<p>​           （3）连接酶测序</p>
<p>　　这一步是Solid测序的独特之处。它并没有采用以前测序时所常用的DNA聚合酶，而是采用了连接酶。Solid连接反应的底物是8碱基单链荧光探针混合物，这里将其简单表示为：3’-XXnnnzzz-5’。连接反应中，这些探针按照碱基互补规则与单链DNA模板链配对。探针的5’末端分别标记了CY5、Texas Red、CY3、6-FAM这4种颜色的荧光染料（图6-a）。这个8碱基单链荧光探针中，第1和第2位碱基（XX）上的碱基是确定的，并根据种类的不同在6-8位（zzz）上加上了不同的荧光标记。这是Solid的独特测序法，两个碱基确定一个荧光信号，相当于一次能决定两个碱基。这种测序方法也称之为两碱基测序法。当荧光探针能够与DNA模板链配对而连接上时，就会发出代表第1，2位碱基的荧光信号，图6-a和图6-b中的比色版所表示的是第1，2位碱基的不同组合与荧光颜色的关系。在记录下荧光信号后，通过化学方法在第5和第6位碱基之间进行切割，这样就能移除荧光信号，以便进行下一个位置的测序。不过值得注意的是，通过这种测序方法，每次测序的位置都相差5位。即第一次是第1、2位，第二次是第6、7位……在测到末尾后，要将新合成的链变性，洗脱。接着用引物n-1进行第二轮测序。引物n-1与引物n的区别是，二者在与接头配对的位置上相差一个碱基（图6-a. 8）。也即是，通过引物n-1在引物n的基础上将测序位置往3’端移动一个碱基位置，因而就能测定第0、1位和第5、6位……第二轮测序完成，依此类推，直至第五轮测序，最终可以完成所有位置的碱基测序，并且每个位置的碱基均被检测了两次。该技术的读长在2×50bp，后续序列拼接同样比较复杂。由于双次检测，这一技术的原始测序准确性高达99.94%，而15x覆盖率时的准确性更是达到了99.999%，应该说是目前第二代测序技术中准确性最高的了。但在荧光解码阶段，鉴于其是双碱基确定一个荧光信号，因而一旦发生错误就容易产生连锁的解码错误。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/10.png" alt="img"></p>
<h1 id="第三代测序技术"><a href="#第三代测序技术" class="headerlink" title="第三代测序技术"></a>第三代测序技术</h1><p>以PacBio公司的<font color="red">SMRT</font>和<font color="red">Oxford Nanopore Technologies纳米孔单分子测序技术</font>，被称之为第三代测序技术。与前两代相比，最大的特点是单分子测序，测序过程<font color="red">无需PCR</font>扩增。</p>
<p>　　PacBio SMRT技术也应用了边合成边测序思想，并以SMRT芯片为测序载体。基本原理： DNA聚合酶和模板结合,4色荧光标记 4 种碱基（即是dNTP）,在碱基配对阶段,不同碱基加入,发不同光,根据<font color="green">光的波长与峰值</font>判断进入碱基类型。 DNA 聚合酶是实现超长读长的关键之一,读长主要跟<font color="red">酶的活性保持</font>有关,它主要受激光对其造成的损伤所影响。</p>
<p>​        PacBio SMRT技术的一个关键是怎样将反应信号与周围游离碱基的<font color="red">强大荧光背景</font>区别。<font color="red"><strong>ZMW（零模波导孔）原理</strong></font>：如同微波炉壁上可看到的很多密集小孔。小孔直径有考究,如果直径大于微波波长,能量就会在衍射效应的作用下穿透面板而泄露出来，从而与周围小孔相互干扰。如果孔径小于波长,能量不会辐射到周围，而是保持直线状态（光衍射的原理）,从而可起保护作用。同理,在一个反应管(SMRTCell:单分子实时反应孔)中有许多这样的圆形纳米小孔, 即 ZMW(零模波导孔),外径 100多纳米,比检测激光波长小(数百纳米),激光从底部打上去后不能穿透小孔进入上方溶液区,能量被限制在一个小范围(体积20X 10-21 L)里,正好足够覆盖需要检测的部分,使得信号仅来自这个小反应区域,孔外过多游离核苷酸单体依然留在黑暗中,从而实现将背景降到最低。另外，可以通过检测相邻两个碱基之间的测序时间，来检测一些碱基修饰情况，既如果碱基存在修饰，则通过聚合酶时的速度会减慢，相邻两峰之间的距离增大，可以通过这个来之间检测甲基化等信息（图7）。SMRT技术的测序速度很快，每秒约10个dNTP。但是，同时其测序<font color="red">错误率比较高</font>（这几乎是目前单分子测序技术的通病），达到<font color="red">15%</font>,但好在它的出错是随机的，并不会像第二代测序技术那样存在测序错误的偏向，因而可以通过<font color="red">多次测序来进行有效的纠错</font>。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/11.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Oxford Nanopore Technologies公司所开发的纳米单分子测序技术与以往的测序技术皆不同，它是基于电信号而不是光信号的测序技术。该技术的关键之一是，他们设计了一种特殊的纳米孔，孔内共价结合有分子接头。当DNA碱基通过纳米孔时，它们使电荷发生变化，从而短暂地影响流过纳米孔的电流强度（每种碱基所影响的电流变化幅度是不同的），灵敏的电子设备检测到这些变化从而鉴定所通过的碱基。</p>
<p>　　该公司在去年基因组生物学技术进展年会(AGBT)上推出第一款商业化的纳米孔测序仪，引起了科学界的极大关注。纳米孔测序（和其他第三代测序技术）有望解决目前测序平台的不足，纳米孔测序的主要特点是：读长很长，大约在几十kb，甚至100 kb;错误率目前介于1%至4%，且是随机错误，而不是聚集在读取的两端;数据可实时读取;通量很高(30x人类基因组有望在一天内完成);起始DNA在测序过程中不被破坏;以及样品制备简单又便宜。理论上，它也能直接测序RNA。</p>
<p>　　纳米孔单分子测序计算还有另一大特点，它能够直接读取出甲基化的胞嘧啶，而不必像传统方法那样对基因组进行bisulfite处理。这对于在基因组水平直接研究表观遗传相关现象有极大的帮助。并且改方法的测序准确性可达99.8%，而且一旦发现测序错误也能较容易地进行纠正。但目前似乎还没有应用该技术的相关报道。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/20/2022-02-20-HiFi-1/12.png" alt="img"></p>
<h1 id="其他测序技术"><a href="#其他测序技术" class="headerlink" title="其他测序技术"></a>其他测序技术</h1><p>目前还有一种基于半导体芯片的新一代革命性测序技术——Ion Torrent6。该技术使用了一种布满小孔的高密度半导体芯片， 一个小孔就是一个测序反应池。当DNA聚合酶把核苷酸聚合到延伸中的DNA链上时，会释放出一个氢离子，反应池中的PH发生改变，位于池下的离子感受器感受到H+离子信号，H+离子信号再直接转化为数字信号，从而读出DNA序列（图9）。这一技术的发明人同时也是454测序技术的发明人之一——Jonathan Rothberg，它的文库和样本制备跟454技术很像，甚至可以说就是454的翻版，只是测序过程中不是通过检测焦磷酸荧光显色，而是通过检测H+信号的变化来获得序列碱基信息。Ion Torrent相比于其他测序技术来说，不需要昂贵的物理成像等设备，因此，成本相对来说会低，体积也会比较小，同时操作也要更为简单，速度也相当快速，除了2天文库制作时间，整个上机测序可在2-3.5小时内完成，不过整个芯片的通量并不高，目前是10G左右，但非常适合小基因组和外显子验证的测序。    </p>
<h1 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h1><p>以上，对各代测序技术的原理做了简要的阐述，这三代测序技术的特点比较汇总在以下表1和表2中。其中测序成本，读长和通量是评估该测序技术先进与否的三个重要指标。第一代和第二代测序技术除了通量和成本上的差异之外，其测序核心原理（除Solid是边连接边测序之外）都是基于边合成边测序的思想。第二代测序技术的优点是成本较之一代大大下降，通量大大提升，但缺点是所引入PCR过程会在一定程度上增加测序的错误率，并且具有系统偏向性，同时读长也比较短。第三代测序技术是为了解决第二代所存在的缺点而开发的，它的根本特点是单分子测序，不需要任何PCR的过程，这是为了能有效避免因PCR偏向性而导致的系统错误，同时提高读长，并要保持二代技术的高通量，低成本的优点。</p>

<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/16/2022-0216-chromosome-structure-Hi-C/0.png" alt="img"></p>
<h1 id="1-C技术"><a href="#1-C技术" class="headerlink" title="1. C技术"></a>1. C技术</h1><h2 id="1-1-3C（一对一）"><a href="#1-1-3C（一对一）" class="headerlink" title="1.1 3C（一对一）"></a>1.1 3C（一对一）</h2><ul>
<li><p>基因组捕获技术（Chromosome conformation capture，3C）是最早研究三维基因组的技术，需要<font color="green">提前知道互作区域</font>，才能<font color="green">量化一对基因组基因座之间的互作</font>。</p>
</li>
<li><p>3C技术2002年Deker提出，目的捕获染色体的interaction，假设染色体中的interaction以蛋白为介导。通过限制酶酶切，补平，连接，打断，PCR后，若染色体A，B两点相互作用，根据这两点特异序列的引物能PCR出产物，验证interaction。每<font color="green">一对位点的验证</font>需要<font color="green">设计一对特异性引物</font>。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-2-4C（一对多）"><a href="#1-2-4C（一对多）" class="headerlink" title="1.2 4C（一对多）"></a>1.2 4C（一对多）</h2><ul>
<li><p>染色体构象捕获芯片（Chromosome conformation capture-on-chip，4C ），可以捕获<font color="green">一个基因区域</font>和其他区域间的互相作用。该技术不需要知道作用区域的先验知识就可以使用。</p>
</li>
<li><p>3C较麻烦，后设计双酶切位点，然后<font color="green">成环</font>，保证只需要设计一对引物就可以检测一个位点对多个位点的相互作用，4C有circle的意思。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-3-5C（多对多）"><a href="#1-3-5C（多对多）" class="headerlink" title="1.3 5C（多对多）"></a>1.3 5C（多对多）</h2><p>染色体构象捕获碳拷贝（Chromosome conformation capture carbon copy，5C） ，可以检测<font color="green">某段区域内所有的互作</font>，但是该<font color="red">区域一般&lt;1 Mb</font>。覆盖度问题造成该技术<font color="green">不适用于全基因组测序</font>。</p>
<h2 id="1-4-Hi-C（全部互作）"><a href="#1-4-Hi-C（全部互作）" class="headerlink" title="1.4 Hi-C（全部互作）"></a>1.4 <font color="red">Hi-C（全部互作）</font></h2><ul>
<li><p>高通量基因组捕获技术（High-throughput/resolution chromosome conformation capture），基本解决了上述技术的缺点，可以实现<font color="green">全基因组覆盖</font>检测<font color="green">全部未知互作区域</font>。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hi-C基本步骤，甲醛交联，限制酶切，末端补平加biotin，平末端连接，超声破碎，biotin富集，建库测序。整个过程没有特异引物存在。</p>
</li>
<li><p>将线性距离远，空间结构近的DNA片段进行交联，并将交联的DNA片段富集，高通量测序，对测序数据分析可以揭示染色质的远程互作，推导出基因组的三维空间结构的可能的记忆之间的调控关系。</p>
</li>
<li><p>\1. 通过Scaffold间的交互频率大小，可以对已组装的基因组序列进行纠错（基因组更准确）。</p>
<p>\2. 基因信息不再仅仅是contig片段，而是被划分至染色体上，成为染色体水平。</p>
<p>\3. 无需辛苦的构建群体，单一一个体就能实现染色体定位。</p>
<p>\4. 相比遗传图谱，标记密度更大，序列定位更完整（能把更多的contig挂至染色体上!信息更全面！）</p>
<p>\5. 染色体重排等结构变异研究可以开展啦~(研究可以更深入！）</p>
<p>\6. QTL、GWAS可以定位区间到某个染色体啦~（追踪变异！）</p>
<p>\7. 该物种的三维基因结构、染色体互作及动态变化可以解析啦~（从基因到表观！全方位解析）</p>

<li><p>Hi-C辅助陆地棉与海岛棉基因组染色体水平组装（<em>Wang et al</em>.,Nature Genetics 2018）</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hi-C无需群体，单一个体就能实现染色体定位。很多物种都无法构建遗传群体，包括大部分高等动物、野生动植物、林木、果树等等。Hi-C是通过染色体上空间距离、线性距离的不同而导致的交互频率的不同来完成染色体的定位，所以不需要构建群体。</p>
</li>

<p>研究背景：</p>
<p>花生作为我国重要的经济作物，是提供重要的蛋白和油料的基础。花生属一共包括30个二倍体品种，1个异源四倍体野生花生(<em>A. monticola</em>)和1个栽培花生(<em>A. hypogaea</em>)。作为栽培花生农艺性状改良的重要野生资源供体，野生四倍体花生一直是国内外学者的研究热点。研究中对花生属唯一的野生异源四倍体花生<em>Arachis monticola</em>基因组进行了研究，同时对17个野生二倍体花生（AA;BB;EE;KK和CC）与30个野生和栽培四倍体花生进行了重测序分析。</p>
<p>研究结果：</p>
<p>1、野生四倍体花生基因组denovo及与栽培四倍体花生的比较分析：</p>
<p>基于 Illumina、PacBio 、Hi-C和光学图谱数据，组装<em>Arachis monticola</em>(2n = 4x = 40)基因组大小为2.62 Gb ，contigs N50=106.66 Kb，scaffolds N50=124.92 Mb；与栽培四倍体花生<em>A. hypogaea</em>基因组结构变异高度保守，且比野生祖先二倍体更加保守；</p>
<p>2、A、B亚基因组的单系起源和多样性：</p>
<p>对17个二倍体野生种（AA、BB、EE、KK和CC）和30个野生和栽培四倍体花生进行了进化树和PCA分析。结果表明，栽培四倍体花生与野生四倍体花生最接近， A和B亚基因组的单系起源（图1）；</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/16/2022-0216-chromosome-structure-Hi-C/36.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>3、四倍体花生不对称亚基因组进化及表达差异 <strong>：</strong></p>
<p>栽培花生和野生花生的亚基因组间的同源序列交换率（HSE）分别为2.46%和2.54%。野生花生中A到B的HSE富集的基因为类黄酮生物合成和昼夜节律途径的基因，暗示不对称HSEs在生物学功能中的作用；</p>
<p>4、SV对荚发育和驯化相关基因表达的影响及抗病基因鉴定 <strong>：</strong></p>
<p>对野生四倍体花生和栽培四倍体花生不同发育阶段荚果的SV分析发现SV在荚果发育过程中基因表达的变化上可能起着重要作用；同时在栽培四倍体花生中鉴定到190个SV抗病基因（SV-RGAs），其中32个基因在接种后易感组或抗性组中表现出显著的表达变化（图2）。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/16/2022-0216-chromosome-structure-Hi-C/37.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>研究结论：</p>
<p>充分注释了高质量野生四倍体花生基因组，揭示了花生亚基因组单系起源和遗传进化模型，表明了野生和栽培四倍体花生亚基因组发生了不对称进化；此外，野生花生中存在的独特等位基因可以改善栽培花生的抗性和荚果大小等形状，为研究多倍体基因组进化、作物驯化和基因组辅助花生生产改良提供独特的价值。</p>

<p>Molecular Cell杂志发表背靠背文章Resolving the 3D Landscape of Transcription-Linked Mammalian Chromatin Folding和Ultrastructural Details of Mammalian Chromosome Architecture。<font color="green">一种新的染色质构象捕捉技术名为Micro-C</font>。Micro-C达到<strong>单核小体长度（～200bp）</strong>左右的<strong>分辨率</strong>，可以观察到更为精细的染色质结构。</p>
<p>Micro-C和Hi-C在实验步骤上最大的不同，在于Micro-C先对核小体上缠绕的DNA做交联，而后用MNase切断核小体之间的连接DNA。以Tjian和Darzacq实验室的文章为例，他们对38个小鼠干细胞进行Micro-C测序，总共获得约26亿个reads。<strong>相似测序深度</strong>下<strong>20kb精度</strong>的<strong>Micro-C图谱与Hi-C结果相似</strong>，但在<strong>100至20kb的精度之间</strong>，<strong>Micro-C</strong>展示<strong>Hi-C不具备</strong>的<strong>精细</strong>结构，例如很多有关基因启动子和增强子的结构域、条带和点圈。从Hi-C可以得到约6000个DNA环（loop），即高度相互作用的一对区域。而Micro-C可以得到约30000个。</p>
<p>在证实了Micro-C具备可重复性和高精度之后，进一步分析，<font color="green">相比Hi-C，Micro-C独特</font>的主要在于可探查<font color="green">调控元件之间相互作用</font>，如EP，PP等。其中有些相互作用形成了比传统TAD小的结构域。研究者通过隔离分值的分析得到了大约13万个这样的结构域边界。这些<font color="green">边界通常有着活跃转录的基因和动态的核小体结构</font>，而与之前所了解的，<font color="green">以CTCF和Cohesin为标志的TAD边界</font>有很大<font color="green">不同</font>。</p>
<p>利用<strong>回归模型</strong>分析了这些<strong>结构域边界</strong>和<strong>表关遗传特征</strong>的<strong>关联性</strong>。<font color="green">CTCF</font>和<font color="green">Cohesin</font>在<font color="green">决定边界位置</font>最重要，然而决定<font color="green">边界强度</font>却主要是<font color="green">转录活跃的标志物</font>，如<font color="green">H3K4me3修饰和染色质开放度</font>等。进一步发现边界也存在很大差别，将其分为五类：<font color="red">转录相关</font>；<font color="red">干细胞特异性增强子</font>；<font color="red">一般增强子</font>；<font color="red">抑制型</font>；<font color="red">CTCF-Cohesin相关型</font>。各有不同的化学修饰。</p>
<p>选取了一些代表性的区域发现，不仅<strong>启动子、增强子和CTCF之间相互作用</strong>，在<strong>聚梳抑制区</strong>还可以观察到显著的<strong>“巢状”环</strong>。<strong>CTCF相互作用范围较长</strong>，而<strong>Pol II</strong>介导的相互作用则<strong>较短</strong>。基因附近的相互作用越紧密，其转录活性也常常越高。进一步<strong>证明</strong><font color="green">转录对染色质折叠</font>的影响，利用<font color="green">药物抑制转录</font>。对比观察到，<font color="green">TAD等大尺度结构无变化</font>，然而<font color="green">基因附近的相互作用</font>条纹<font color="green">大大减弱</font>，证明了这些条纹团确实是由转录过程导致的。</p>
<p>两篇文章显示了<strong>哺乳动物</strong>的<font color="green">染色质相互作用</font>还有<font color="green">更多的精细结构等待开发</font>。更高精度的数据能帮助人们理解这些<strong>结构的形成和对基因转录的影响</strong>。</p>

<p><font color="green">染色质高级结构</font>由不同层次的结构单元组成。从<font color="green">区块（compartment）</font>，<font color="green">拓扑结构域（TAD）</font>，到单个的<font color="green">环（loop）</font>，这些大小不同的单元各有特征，也对<strong>染色质功能</strong>和<strong>基因表达</strong>起到多种多样的<strong>调控</strong>。CTCF蛋白扮演了重要的角色。</p>
<p><font color="red">CTCF</font>常常位于<strong>TAD和loop的边界</strong>，起到“<font color="red">隔离子</font>”的作用。近年来提出的loop extrusion模型也认为<font color="green">CTCF和cohesin的协调作用是loop形成的普遍机理</font>。虽然有假设，却一直不清楚CTCF<font color="red">如何作用</font>于染色质，并导致复杂结构形成。CTCF蛋白的各个结构域，除了同DNA结合的11-ZF外，其他结构域功能？</p>
<p>2019年9月12日，Molecular Cell杂志发表背靠背文章“Distinct Classes of ChromatinLoops Revealed by Deletion of anRNA-Binding Region in CTCF”和“RNA Interactions Are Essentialfor CTCF-Mediated Genome Organization”<strong>，</strong>共同揭示<font color="green">CTCF与RNA的相互作用</font>对CTCF功能的重要意义。</p>
<p>之前研究发现<font color="green">CTCF常在细胞中成簇聚集</font>。为研究聚集的<font color="green">机理</font>，在细胞中分别加入<font color="green">DNase和RNase</font>。结果吃惊，被认为是DNA结合蛋白的CTCF的聚合对<font color="green">DNase并不敏感</font>，而<font color="green">RNase却显著减少了CTCF的互相结合</font>。 结合之前研究，CTCF上的ZF10和ZF11结构域有一段具有RNA结合功能（<font color="red">RNA-binding region</font>，<strong>RBR</strong>），其中<strong>38个氨基酸</strong>对其结合是必不可少。研究者于是在<font color="red">小鼠干细胞</font>上将这段被称为<font color="red">RBRi的片段替换</font>，发现<font color="green">缺陷型细胞</font>的<strong>CTCF表达水平</strong>虽然<strong>无明显变化</strong>，<strong>生长却慢了2倍</strong>，显示<strong>RBRi</strong>可能具有重要的<strong>生理作用</strong>。RBRi缺陷的CTCF在细胞中和RNA的<font color="green">结合减少但却没有完全消失</font>。研究者接着对<strong>RBRi缺陷和不缺陷的CTCF</strong>分别做了荧光<strong>标记</strong>。结果<strong>野生型CTCF</strong>呈现了明显<strong>更高程度聚团</strong>。不过这些结果并<strong>不排除RBRi间接作用</strong>于其他因子的可能。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/16/2022-0216-chromosome-structure-Micro-C/1.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>研究者接着分析了**<font color="red">RBRi片段功能和Compartment，TAD，Loop三大结构单元的关系</font><strong>。对</strong>RBRi缺陷<strong>和</strong>野生型<strong>细胞</strong>Micro-C测序<strong>。Micro-C是一种比Hi-C清晰度更高的研究基因组范围染色质相互作用的方法。RBRi的<font color="green">缺陷并不影响compartment形成</font>，但却</strong><font color="red">大范围改变了TAD和loop的结构</font>**。将RBRi<font color="green">替换后</font>，小鼠细胞内<font color="green">TAD的数目和强度都有所减少</font>，其中<font color="green">大部分同TAD边缘CTCF和Cohesin的ChIP-seq信号变化一致</font>。RBRi的替换也使得<font color="green"><strong>Micro-C</strong></font>热图上的<font color="green"><strong>条带（strip）变长</strong></font>，这符合loop extrusion模型的假设。而loop的改变更为有趣–有些loop完全明显削弱（38%～57%），而有些loop却完好无损甚至增强了。研究者于是<font color="green"><strong>将loop分成RBRi依赖和不依赖两类</strong></font>，并发现它们具有不同的转录因子结合特征。他们还据此假设，这两类loop同CTCF有不同的结合方式，因此稳定性也不同。这也许可以解释为什么不是所有的CTCF位点都会形成loop。最后，发现大约500个基因由于RBRi的替换产生了差异表达。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/16/2022-0216-chromosome-structure-Micro-C/2.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Danny Reinberg实验室则将目光集中在<strong>CTCF的ZF1和ZF10结构域</strong>上。他们发现对小鼠细胞的转录抑制在没有降低CTCF表达水平的前提下，减少了CTCF在全基因组范围的结合程度。<font color="red">ZF1或ZF10缺陷的CTCF与RNA的结合能力都大大减少，并且在一定程度导致CTCF结合位点和基因表达改变。而不同的是，ZF1缺陷使得大部分CTCF loop消失，而ZF10缺陷型细胞的loop却仍然保持完好。</font></p>

<p>CTCF什么都有。转录因子与成千上万个基因组位点结合，有些是组织特异性的，有些是超保守的。它可以作为<strong>转录激活因子</strong>、<strong>抑制子</strong>和<strong>绝缘子</strong>，并可以<strong>暂停转录</strong>。CTCF<strong>结合</strong>在<strong>染色质结构域边界</strong>，<strong>增强子</strong>和<strong>启动子</strong>，以及<strong>基因区</strong>。它可以吸引许多其他转录因子到染色质，包括组织特异性转录激活因子、抑制子、粘连蛋白和RNA聚合酶II，并形成染色质环。因此，CTCF在特定基因组位点的确切功能是不可预测的。它似乎是由相关的转录因子、结合位点相对于基因转录起始位点的位置、以及该位点在染色质环中与其他ctcf位点的结合、与增强子或启动子的结合决定的。该review将讨论CTCF结合事件的全基因组特征，以及这个显著的转录因子的位点特异性功能。</p>
<ol>
<li>introduction</li>
</ol>
<p>CTCF是一种普遍表达的必需蛋白，在许多方面都是一种特殊的转录因子。它最初被描述为转录<strong>抑制</strong>因子，但也被发现作为转录<strong>激活</strong>因子。还具有<strong>绝缘体活性</strong>:当它位于增强子和基因启动子之间时，它阻断它们的通信并阻止转录激活。通过<strong>ChIP-seq</strong>系统研究，在<strong>不同物种的许多组织</strong>中绘制CTCF在基因组尺度的结合事件。结果显示基因组被<strong>无数的CTCF结合位点</strong>所覆盖。与大多数其他转录因子相比，CTCF似乎<strong>更容易</strong>与基因间序列<strong>结合</strong>，通常<strong>距</strong>离转录起始位点(<strong>TSS</strong>)<strong>较远</strong>。CTCF是<strong>最早被证实介导染色质成环</strong>的蛋白之一。进一步观察到，它经常会<strong>结合</strong>到位于细胞核中不同位置的<strong>染色体区域之间的边界</strong>，<strong>结合</strong>具有<strong>不同表观遗传特征</strong>和/或<strong>不同转录活性</strong>的<strong>区域边界</strong>，以及最近确定的<strong>拓扑域之间的边界</strong>，这是空间上确定的<strong>染色体单位</strong>，在其中<strong>序列优先相互作用</strong>。本文讨论CTCF的研究，并评估其在<strong>基因组折叠</strong>和<strong>基因表达</strong>中的功能。</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>CTCF在<strong>Β-globin</strong>和<strong>h19-igf2</strong>位点:一个短暂的历史</li>
</ol>
<p>多功能DNA结合蛋白CTCF的功能最初是在<strong>单个位点</strong>上探索的，特别是在<strong>β-珠蛋白位点</strong>和<strong>印迹H19-Igf2位点</strong>。<strong>chicken β-珠蛋白位点</strong>在其5 ‘侧携带一个DNaseI超敏位点(5 ‘ hs4)，该位点将该位点<strong>与邻近的异染色质分离</strong>，该位点被发现能够<strong>阻断增强子活性</strong>。CTCF随后被证明与5 ‘ hs4的绝缘体活性有关。人和小鼠的β-珠蛋白位点也位于不活跃染色质的大染色体区域内，并类似地被ctcf结合位点包围。这些被怀疑会对进入的异染色质形成屏障，但它们的缺失不会导致β-珠蛋白位点的关闭或失活。<strong>染色体构象捕获(3C)技术</strong>的应用使β-珠蛋白CTCF位点的物理相互作用成为可能。它们形成<strong>大染色质环</strong>，包括β-珠蛋白的主要调节元件，<strong>Locus control region基因位点控制区(LCR)<strong>及其</strong>基因</strong>。这些环是红细胞特异性的，在lcr介导的β-珠蛋白基因高表达之前，在红细胞祖细胞中形成(图1a;)。据推测，CTCF环可以<strong>促进LCR与其靶基因之间的后续空间相互作用</strong>，但这方面的证据仍然缺乏。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/15/2022-02-15-CTCF/1.png"></p>
<p>Figure 1. CTCF，染色质环和特定基因位点的转录调控。(a)<strong>位于β-珠蛋白位点的基因</strong>受<strong>基因位点控制区(LCR)*<em><strong>控制。</strong>ctcf结合位点相互作用</em>*，形成</strong>染色质枢纽<strong>，其中包含</strong>LCR和β-珠蛋白基因<strong>。在</strong>红细胞分化<strong>时，</strong>红细胞特异性转录因子和内聚蛋白能够形成一个活跃的染色质枢纽<strong>，其中</strong>LCR与基因接触并增强其表达<strong>。(b) H19和Igf2基因的印迹表达是通过CTCF在印迹控制区(ICR)的甲基化依赖结合介导的。(i)在父系等位基因上，ICR的甲基化</strong>阻止CTCF结合**，并通过远端增强子(E)与Igf2启动子的接触介导Igf2基因的表达。(ii) <strong>CTCF结合在ICR上阻断了Igf2基因和远端增强子之间的通信</strong>，从而导致母源等位基因H19基因的表达。</p>
<p>印迹H19/Igf2位点。该位点包含一个<strong>差异甲基化区域</strong>，称为<strong>印迹控制区(ICR)<strong>，位于H19和Igf2基因之间。ICR决定了H19在</strong>母体等位基因</strong>上<strong>活跃</strong>，而<strong>Igf2</strong>则是从<strong>父系等位基因转录</strong>而来的。当CTCF被发现以<strong>甲基化依赖</strong>的方式与<strong>ICR结合</strong>时，CTCF进入了这个阶段:<strong>CTCF与未甲基化的母源ICR的结合阻</strong>止了H19基因附近的共享增强子<strong>跨越并激活</strong>Igf2。在<strong>父系等位基因CTCF不能发挥其绝缘体活性，因为DNA甲基化阻止了其与ICR的结合</strong>(图1b;)。染色质环再次形成，似乎对ICR的功能很重要。带有增强子和启动子的等位基因特异性染色质环是由母体的、与ctcf结合的ICR形成的，这表明这种接触可能是ctcf介导的绝缘体活性的基础。总的来说，早期关于CTCF在β-珠蛋白和H19-Igf2位点功能的研究表明，该蛋白可以<strong>干扰启动子-增强子通信</strong>。CTCF可以在其结合位点之间形成染色质环，也可能与其他调控序列形成染色质环。</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>CTCF通过基因组与染色质边界、增强子和基因启动子结合</li>
</ol>
<p>通过ChIP对全基因组结合位点的定位发现，CTCF可与数万个基因组位点结合。在不同的细胞类型中，大约<strong>三分之一的位点相对保守</strong>。一项对五种哺乳动物肝脏中CTCF结合谱的物种间比较发现，物种和组织之间大约有5000个超<strong>保守位点</strong>。这些似乎是<strong>高亲和力的结合位点</strong>，提示亲和力的差异可能与的保守强度有关。逆转录因子的激活产生了物种特异性的CTCF结合位点的扩展，这种形式的基因组进化在哺乳动物中仍然高度活跃。基于一致motif评分对CTCF结合位点进行分类得出了类似的结论:<strong>高占用位点似乎在所有细胞类型中都是保守的，而低占用位点则更受组织限制</strong>。</p>
<p>CTCF一致结合序列包含CpG，因此可能受到DNA甲基化的影响。CTCF能够在<strong>体外结合甲基化DNA序列</strong>，但<strong>优先结合未甲基化的序列</strong>，在H19-Igf2位点也可以看到。事实上，DNA甲基化似乎在CTCF的一些组织特异性结合事件中发挥作用。此外，<strong>CTCF</strong>可以通过与两种与DNA甲基化相关的酶:多聚(adp -核糖)聚合酶1 (<strong>PARP1</strong>)和无处不在表达的DNA(胞嘧啶-5)甲基转移酶1 (<strong>DNMT1</strong>)形成<strong>复合物来影响DNA甲基化</strong>。<strong>CTCF激活PARP1, PARP1在DNMT1上添加adp -核糖基团使DNMT1失活，从而维持无甲基CpGs的存在</strong>。</p>
<p><strong>部分CTCF结合位点</strong>在<strong>活性染色质</strong>(<strong>高H2K5Ac</strong>)和<strong>非活性</strong>染色质结构域(<strong>高H3K27me3</strong>)之<strong>间</strong>的过渡<strong>富集</strong>。对于逆转录转座的CTCF结合位点似乎尤其如此。CTCF位点经常位于所谓的<strong>膜相关域</strong>(lad)旁边。lad是与<strong>覆盖核膜内侧的层状蛋白网络相关的染色体区域</strong>;这些染色体区域往往是<strong>转录不活跃</strong>的。它的存在提示<strong>CTCF有助于染色质的三维结构的组织</strong>。在果蝇中，CTCF的抑制导致非活性域内H3K27me3水平的降低，表明CTCF在边界上的结合是<strong>维持抑制</strong>所必需的。CTCF的关联伴随着细胞分化过程中<strong>活性域和非活性域的重置</strong>，进一步表明它的功能是<strong>分离不同的染色质状态</strong>。一些lad在细胞分化过程中也会发生动态变化[35]，但CTCF是否与这些差异lad的边界结合目前尚不清楚。</p>
<p>尽管CTCF结合常出现在TSSs远端，但它确实与<strong>基因密度有很强的相关性</strong>(图2a,b)。事实上，CTCF在转录调控中<strong>直接作用的证据来自于早期对单个基因的研究</strong>。在全基因组范围内，部分CTCF位点与<strong>启动子特异性H3K4me3标记共定位</strong>，另一部分与<strong>增强子标记H3K4me1重合</strong>。启动子上的CTCF结合事件在组织中趋于<strong>保守</strong>，而CTCF与增强子的结合则更受<strong>组织限制</strong>。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2022/02/15/2022-02-15-CTCF/2.png"></p>

<li>CTCF在单个基因位点的功能</li>
<li>CTCF介导的全基因组染色质环</li>
</ol>
<p>CTCF的基因组结合位点(通过全基因组<strong>ChIP</strong>)与<strong>Hi-C</strong>生成的<strong>genome-wide DNA contact map</strong>的计算交叉表明，CTCF参与染色体之间和基因组内的染色质相互作用。染色质相互作用分析与配对末端标记测序<strong>Chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET)</strong> 结合了ChIP和3C方法，用于研究由<strong>感兴趣的蛋白质介导的全基因组DNA相互作用</strong>。当靶向CTCF时，ChIA-PET揭示了蛋白介导的大约<strong>1500个染色体内</strong>和<strong>300个染色体间</strong>的相互作用。随后，根据<strong>组蛋白标记</strong>的分布，对<strong>染色体内环</strong>所包围的<strong>区域(10-200 kb)进行聚类</strong>。这表明CTCF环可以包含从环外非活性染色质分离出来的活性染色质，反之亦然。CTCF还可以同时<strong>捕获染色质环中的增强子和启动子</strong>。在大约<strong>40000个CTCF结合位点</strong>中，只有<strong>一小部分</strong>参与了大约1500个CTCF介导的<strong>环</strong>。这意味着不是所有CTCF介导的相互作用都被识别出来了，或者<strong>大多数CTCF位点没有参与环的形成</strong>。</p>
<p>后者很可能是正确的，因为5C(<strong>chromosome conformation capture carbon copy</strong>染色体构象捕获碳复制)技术表明，在1%的基因组中，大多数CTCF位点不参与染色质环，无论它们是否被内聚蛋白共同占据。<strong>CTCF结合序列常被基因启动子跳过，与增强子或更远的CTCF位点进行接触</strong>。</p>
<p>最近大量的全基因组DNA相互作用数据集有助于<strong>评估CTCF对染色体拓扑的影响</strong>。染色体上靠近<strong>CTCF结合位点的序列</strong>显示在它们的DNA接触中存在偏倚:它们与<strong>CTCF位点同侧</strong>的其他<strong>序列的相互作用</strong>大于与<strong>CTCF位点跨侧</strong>的序列的相互作用(图3a;)。同样的结果也出现在果蝇中另一种不同的绝缘体蛋白上:它与一个位点的结合阻止了侧翼序列在这个位点上相互接触。有趣的是，这可能为绝缘体的功能提供了一种解释:它们可以阻止DNA在绝缘序列上的空间接触。在一个特别详细的全基因组DNA接触研究中，<strong>拓扑域</strong>被定义;它们是<strong>平均大小为1mb的染色体区域</strong>，其中<strong>序列优先相互作用</strong>。在组织之间，甚至在物种之间，拓扑结构域具有很强的<strong>保持性</strong>，这表明这些结构域对<strong>细胞的特异性身份没有贡献</strong>。有趣的是，CTCF结合位点在这些<strong>区域边界周围的20kb窗口中富集</strong>(图3b)，再次强调了其作为<strong>染色质组织者</strong>的作用。其中一项研究表明，边界的破坏会导致拓扑域的混合，并导致相关基因的表达失调[79]。不同于拓扑域本身，域内的接触在分化过程中是变化的。在这里，CTCF似乎发挥了作用，可能适应基因表达的发育变化。</p>

<ol start="8">
<li>结论</li>
</ol>
<p>尽管CTCF一直是研究的热点，但它仍然是一种<strong>神秘的转录因子</strong>。它与基因组中成千上万个位点结合，与大量其他转录因子相互作用。它常被发现参与染色质<strong>环</strong>，有时有，有时没有<strong>内聚蛋白</strong>的参与。它可以<strong>与其他CTCF结合位点</strong>形<strong>成</strong>染色质<strong>环</strong>，也可以与<strong>增强子</strong>和<strong>启动子</strong>序列形<strong>成</strong>染色质<strong>环</strong>。CTCF不仅与基因内外的序列结合，也与<strong>基因体内</strong>的<strong>序列结合</strong>，在基因体内它似乎能够<strong>暂停滑动聚合酶分子</strong>。最后，CTCF结合位点仍然作为<strong>反转录转座序列</strong>活跃地跳跃，使CTCF结合景观在不同哺乳动物物种之间具有多样性。</p>
<p>可以解释CTCF与染色质关联的许多，<strong>有时是相反的功能</strong>后果的统一主题可能是其<strong>成环能力</strong>。根据环中包含的序列和环外的序列，由CTCF形成的染色质可能会<strong>促进或阻碍增强子和靶基因之间的三维接触</strong>，从而产生不同的转录结果。许多问题仍然存在:为什么一些CTCF位点形成染色质环而另一些则没有?这在多大程度上依赖于相关的蛋白质因子?当蛋白质与染色质结合时，它是如何设法与这么多其他转录因子相互作用的?一种可能是CTCF作为染色质扫描转录因子的路障，当遇到结合蛋白时，这些转录因子以某种方式被困住。ctcf介导的染色体间接触有何相关性?CTCF是否通过阻止3D DNA接触来阻断增强子-启动子通信?或者绝缘是否涉及绝缘体序列与增强剂和启动剂的物理相互作用?这些问题的答案需要能够预测给定的CTCF结合事件是否在功能上不相关，是否会引起转录激活或抑制，是否会干扰转录激活或会产生染色质边界。</p>

<p><strong>转录组数据中筛选关键基因</strong></p>
<p>筛选关键基因的方法有3类：</p>
<p>1.表达量﹢功能富集</p>
<p>2.表达量﹢实验</p>
<p>3.表达量﹢序列</p>
<p>上面的三种方法不难看出，筛选关键基因的<font color="green">核心</font>是<font color="green">表达量</font>，其实转录组的核心就是以表达量为核心展开其他分析的，然后再附加其他一些信息，找出目标基因；最后将分析结果与研究目的巧妙融合，如果再做一些基因功能实验验证（高分必备，可不做），一篇高质量的文章就ok了。</p>
<p><strong>1.表达量﹢功能富集</strong></p>
<p>Zhu T, Wang X, Xu Z, Xu J, Li R, et al. (2020) Screening of key genes responsible for Pennisetum setaceum ‘Rubrum’ leaf color using tranome sequencing. PLOS ONE 15(11): e0242618.</p>
<p>该文研究对象狼尾草观赏草植物，<font color="green">高光</font>环产紫色叶子，<font color="green">低光</font>产浅紫色或绿色叶子。该文鉴定与<font color="green">叶片着色相关的关键基因</font>，并阐明参与狼尾草叶子的颜色变化的分子机制。</p>
<p>差异表达基因分析总共鉴定了19043个DEGs，与T0（未处理阶段的叶子）阶段的表达相比，在T1（遮阴12天后新叶子完全变绿的阶段）阶段上调和下调的基因分别为10761和8642。<font color="green">KEGG富集分析发现，显著富集的通路主要有类黄酮的生物合成，黄酮和黄酮醇的生物合成以及类胡萝卜素的生物合成</font>。<font color="red">基因筛选(显著KEGG内的基因筛选？)</font>发现存在与<strong>叶绿素代谢</strong>有关的31个差异表达基因，其中21个与叶绿素的生物<strong>合成</strong>有关，有10个与叶绿素的<strong>降解</strong>有关，以及3个与叶绿素<strong>降解调控</strong>有关的转录因子，<strong>花青素的合成和积</strong>累有31个关键酶基因，4个可能参与<strong>花色苷代谢调控</strong>的转录因子（图1所示） 。</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021/12/20/2021_12_20_GO_KEGG_post/selectDEG.png" alt="selectDEG"></p>
<p>快速筛选出感兴趣的基因：基因长度、基因在样品中的表达量、<strong>差异倍数</strong>、<strong>注释信息</strong>等。</p>
<p><font color="green">找显著通路里的基因。做一个信息表。</font></p>
<p><strong>2.表达量﹢实验</strong></p>
<p>Wang A, Chao T, Ji Z, Xuan R, Liu S, Guo M, Wang G, Wang J. 2020. Tranome analysis reveals potential immune function-related regulatory genes/pathways of female Lubo goat submandibular glands at different developmental stages. PeerJ 8:e9947.</p>
<p>课题组前期的基因功能实验或文献查阅来借助别人的已经验证过的基因功能结果，之后再根据表达量筛选关键基因。</p>
<p>转录组研究的目的就是寻找与实验设计相关的关键基因，一般来说研究某生理现象都先要阅读大量文献来判断该实验的可行性。如转录组分析揭示了雌性鲁波<strong>山羊下颌腺</strong>在<strong>不同发育阶段</strong>的潜在<strong>免疫功能相关调节基因</strong>或途径</p>
<p>该文研究的目的是通过<strong>转录组测序</strong>来<strong>定位</strong>差异表达基因（DEG）在<strong>三个不同阶段的表达谱</strong>，预测在<strong>不同发育阶段</strong>的<strong>下颌下腺的免疫功能</strong>。由于<strong>人、小鼠、大鼠、牛</strong>的下颌腺都检测到了<strong>相关抗体</strong>，并且研究发现了下颌腺中的<strong>类红细胞分化因子、内皮素、肝细胞生长因子（HGF）、转移性生长因子（MGF）、转化生长因子-α（TGF-α）和其他因子</strong>。所以在<strong>后续的基因筛选中会重点关注相关因子的表达基因</strong>。</p>
<p>从上面例子中可以发现一个<strong>套路</strong>，先查阅模式生物中该方面的研究结果，然后再结合自己的研究项目筛选出基因，并且<strong>重点关注模式生物中已知的功能基因有没有较大的差异倍数</strong>。</p>

<p><strong>awk、sed、grep更适合的方向：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> grep 更适合单纯的查找或匹配文本</li>
<li> sed 更适合编辑匹配到的文本</li>
<li> awk 更适合格式化文本，对文本进行较复杂格式处理</li>
</ul>
<p>关于awk内建变量个人见解，简单易懂</p>
<p>解释一下变量：</p>
<p>变量：分为内置变量和自定义变量;输入分隔符FS和输出分隔符OFS都属于内置变量。</p>
<p>内置变量就是awk预定义好的、内置在awk内部的变量，而自定义变量就是用户定义的变量。</p>
<ul>
<li> FS(Field Separator)：输入字段分隔符， 默认为空白字符</li>
<li> OFS(Out of Field Separator)：输出字段分隔符， 默认为空白字符</li>
<li> RS(Record Separator)：输入记录分隔符(输入换行符)， 指定输入时的换行符</li>
<li> ORS(Output Record Separate)：输出记录分隔符（输出换行符），输出时用指定符号代替换行符</li>
<li> NF(Number for Field)：当前行的字段的个数(即当前行被分割成了几列)</li>
<li> NR(Number of Record)：行号，当前处理的文本行的行号。</li>
<li> FNR：各文件分别计数的行号</li>
<li> ARGC：命令行参数的个数</li>
<li> ARGV：数组，保存的是命令行所给定的各参数</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>自定义变量的方法</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> 方法一：-v varname=value ，变量名区分字符大小写。</li>
<li> 方法二：在program中直接定义。</li>
</ul>

    <title>Linux command xargs</title>
    <url>/blog/2021/12/17/2021_12_17_Linux_xargs_command/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Linux-command-【xargs】"><a href="#Linux-command-【xargs】" class="headerlink" title="Linux command 【xargs】"></a>Linux command 【xargs】</h2><span id="more"></span>

<h1 id="Linux-xargs-命令"><a href="#Linux-xargs-命令" class="headerlink" title="Linux xargs 命令"></a>Linux xargs 命令</h1><p><a href="https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-command-manual.html"><img src="/blog/Linux.command/up.gif" alt="Linux 命令大全"> Linux 命令大全</a></p>
<p>xargs（英文全拼： eXtended ARGuments）是给<font color="green">命令传递参数</font>的一个过滤器，也是<font color="green">组合多个命令</font>的一个工具。</p>
<p>xargs 可以将管道或标准输入（stdin）数据转换成命令行参数，也能够从文件的输出中读取数据。</p>
<p>xargs 也可以将单行或多行文本输入转换为其他格式，例如<font color="green">多行变单行，单行变多行</font>。</p>
<p>xargs 默认命令是 echo，这意味着通过<font color="green">管道传递给 xargs 的输入包含换行和空白</font>，通过 xargs 的处理，<font color="green">换行和空白将被空格取代</font>。</p>
<p>xargs 是一个强有力的命令，它能够捕获一个命令的输出，然后传递给另外一个命令。</p>
<p>之所以能用到这个命令，关键是由于很多命令不支持|管道来传递参数，而日常工作中有有这个必要，所以就有了 xargs 命令，例如：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">find /sbin -perm +700 |ls -l       <span class="comment">#这个命令是错误的</span></span><br><span class="line">find /sbin -perm +700 |xargs ls -l   <span class="comment">#这样才是正确的</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>xargs 一般是和管道一起使用。</p>
<p><strong>命令格式：</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">somecommand |xargs -item  <span class="built_in">command</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><strong>参数：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>-a file 从文件中读入作为 stdin</li>
<li>-e flag ，注意有的时候可能会是-E，flag必须是一个以空格分隔的标志，当xargs分析到含有flag这个标志的时候就停止。</li>
<li>-p 当每次执行一个argument的时候询问一次用户。</li>
<li>-n num 后面加次数，表示命令在执行的时候一次用的argument的个数，默认是用所有的。</li>
<li>-t 表示先打印命令，然后再执行。</li>
<li><font color="green">-i 或是-I</font>，这得看linux支持了，将xargs的每项名称，一般是<font color="green">一行一行赋值给 {}，可以用 {} 代替</font>。</li>
<li>-r no-run-if-empty 当xargs的输入为空的时候则停止xargs，不用再去执行了。</li>
<li>-s num 命令行的最大字符数，指的是 xargs 后面那个命令的最大命令行字符数。</li>
<li><font color="green">-L num 从标准输入一次读取 num 行送给 command 命令</font>。</li>
<li>-l 同 -L。</li>
<li>-d delim 分隔符，默认的xargs分隔符是回车，argument的分隔符是空格，这里修改的是xargs的分隔符。</li>
<li>-x exit的意思，主要是配合-s使用。。</li>
<li>-P 修改最大的进程数，默认是1，为0时候为as many as it can ，这个例子我没有想到，应该平时都用不到的吧。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="实例"><a href="#实例" class="headerlink" title="实例"></a>实例</h3><p>xargs 用作替换工具，读取输入数据重新格式化后输出。</p>
<p>定义一个测试文件，内有多行文本数据：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cat test.txt</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">a b c d e f g</span><br><span class="line">h i j k l m n</span><br><span class="line">o p q</span><br><span class="line">r s t</span><br><span class="line">u v w x y z</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><font color="green">多行输入单行输出：</font></p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cat test.txt | xargs</span></span><br><span class="line">a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><font color="green">-n 选项多行输出：</font></p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cat test.txt | xargs -n3</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">a b c</span><br><span class="line">d e f</span><br><span class="line">g h i</span><br><span class="line">j k l</span><br><span class="line">m n o</span><br><span class="line">p q r</span><br><span class="line">s t u</span><br><span class="line">v w x</span><br><span class="line">y z</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>-d 选项可以自定义一个定界符：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># echo &quot;nameXnameXnameXname&quot; | xargs -dX</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">name name name name</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>结合 -n 选项使用：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># echo &quot;nameXnameXnameXname&quot; | xargs -dX -n2</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">name name</span><br><span class="line">name name</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>读取 stdin，将格式化后的参数传递给命令</p>
<p>假设一个命令为 sk.sh 和一个保存参数的文件 arg.txt：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">#!/bin/bash</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">#sk.sh命令内容，打印出所有参数。</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">echo</span> $*</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>arg.txt文件内容：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cat arg.txt</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">aaa</span><br><span class="line">bbb</span><br><span class="line">ccc</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>xargs 的一个选项 -I，使用 -I 指定一个替换字符串 {}，这个字符串在 xargs 扩展时会被替换掉，当 -I 与 xargs 结合使用，每一个参数命令都会被执行一次：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cat arg.txt | xargs -I &#123;&#125; ./sk.sh -p &#123;&#125; -l</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">-p aaa -l</span><br><span class="line">-p bbb -l</span><br><span class="line">-p ccc -l</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>复制所有图片文件到 /data/images 目录下：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls *.jpg | xargs -n1 -I &#123;&#125; cp &#123;&#125; /data/images</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>xargs 结合 find 使用</p>
<p>用 rm 删除太多的文件时候，可能得到一个错误信息：**/bin/rm Argument list too long.** 用 xargs 去避免这个问题：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">find . -<span class="built_in">type</span> f -name <span class="string">&quot;*.log&quot;</span> -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>xargs -0 将 \0 作为定界符。</p>
<p>统计一个源代码目录中所有 php 文件的行数：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">find . -<span class="built_in">type</span> f -name <span class="string">&quot;*.php&quot;</span> -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>查找所有的 jpg 文件，并且压缩它们：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">find . -<span class="built_in">type</span> f -name <span class="string">&quot;*.jpg&quot;</span> -<span class="built_in">print</span> | xargs tar -czvf images.tar.gz</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>xargs 其他应用</p>
<p>假如有<font color="green">一个文件包含了很多希望下载的 URL</font>，你能够使用 xargs下载所有链接：</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># cat url-list.txt | xargs wget -c</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>无监督学习：数据无标注甚至非结构化。KMeans…</p>
<span id="more"></span>



<h1 id="KMeans"><a href="#KMeans" class="headerlink" title="KMeans"></a>KMeans</h1><h2 id="简介-聚类与KMeans"><a href="#简介-聚类与KMeans" class="headerlink" title="简介-聚类与KMeans"></a>简介-聚类与KMeans</h2><blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>聚类（Clustering）</strong>：将数据对象分为多个类或者簇 (Cluster)，使同一簇对象间较高相似度，不同簇对象差别较大。</li>
<li><strong>划分（Partitioning）</strong>：聚类可基于划分，也可基于分层。划分即将对象划分成不同簇，而分层将对象分等级。</li>
<li><strong>排他（Exclusive）</strong>：一个数据对象，只能被划分到一个簇。如果一个数据对象可被划分到多个簇，则称为可重叠（Overlapping）。</li>
<li><strong>距离（Distance）</strong>：基于距离的聚类将距离近的相似对象聚在一起。基于<font color="red">概率分布模型的聚类？</font>在一组对象中，找到符合特定分布模型的对象的集合，不一定是距离最近的或者最相似的，而是能完美的呈现出概率分布模型所描述的模型。</li>
<li>欧氏距离：欧几里得度量二维和三维空间中的欧氏距离就是两点之间的实际距离</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>与分类、序列标注不同，聚类事先并不知道任何样本标签，通过数据之间内在关系把样本划分为若干类别，使得同类别样本之间的相似度高，不同类别相似度低（增大类内聚，减少类间距）。</p>
</li>
<li><p>聚类属于非监督学习，K均值聚类最基础常用。基本思想，<font color="green">通过迭代寻找K个簇（Cluster），使聚类结果对应的损失函数最小</font>。终止条件是没有（或最小数目）对象被重新分配给不同的聚类，没有（或最小数目）聚类中心再发生变化，误差平方和局部最小。<font color="red">损失函数定义为各个样本距离所属簇中心点的误差平方和</font>：</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/2021/11/15/2021-11-15-kmeans/1.png"></p>
<p>xi代表第i个样本，ci是xi所属的簇，uci代表簇对应中心点，M是样本总数。</p>
<ul>
<li><p>？损失函数本质是衡量模型的拟合效果，有求解参数需求的算法，才会有损失函数。Kmeans 不求解什么参数，它的模型本质也没有在拟合数据，而是在对数据进行一 种探索。在决策树中有衡量分类效果的指标准确度<code>accuracy</code>，准确度所对应的损失叫做泛化误差，但不能通过最小化泛化误差来求解某个模型中需要的信息，只是希望模型的效果上表现出来的泛化误差 很小。因此决策树，KNN 等算法，是绝对没有损失函数的。</p>

</li>
<li><p>  上述问题是<font color="green">NP-Hard</font>问题。一般是采用坐标下降（Coordinate Decendet）方法求解。坐标下降法属于非梯度优化方法，每一步迭代中沿着一个坐标轴方向探索，通过循环使用不同的坐标达到求解目标函数的局部最小值。 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/2021/11/15/2021-11-15-kmeans/4.png"></p>
<p>如上图，假设两维度x，y：</p>
<ol>
<li>首先选择初始位置(x,y)，假设x未知将y的值代入目标函数中，令目标函数导数0，求得此时最佳x值。</li>
<li>又假设y未知将刚求得x的值代入目标函数，令目标函数导数0，求得此时最佳y。</li>
<li>重复执行第1步第2步，目标函数逐渐接近极小值点，直到达到了极小值点停止。</li>
</ol>
<p>收敛的过程如红色箭头所示。更多维度时，同理，一次只对一个维度最优化。</p>
<p>坐标下降法一般要求目标函数是可微的凸函数(局部最小值即全局最小值?)，此时求得的极小值才能是全局最小值。</p>
<p>使用K-Means前，可先用PCA使各个变量间尽可能独立。否则如两变量间有较强关联性，函数收敛速度会非常慢。</p>
<h2 id="步骤"><a href="#步骤" class="headerlink" title="步骤"></a>步骤</h2><p>KMeans的核心目标是将给定的数据集划分成K个簇（K是超参），并给出每个样本数据对应的中心点。具体步骤非常简单，可以分为4步：</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021/11/15/2021-11-15-kmeans/2.png"></p>
<p><strong>KMeans最核心的部分就是先固定中心点，调整每个样本所属的类别来减少J；再固定每个样本的类别，调整中心点继续减小J 。两个过程交替循环， J 单调递减直到最（极）小值，中心点和样本划分的类别同时收敛。</strong></p>

<h1 id="优缺点优化策略"><a href="#优缺点优化策略" class="headerlink" title="优缺点优化策略"></a>优缺点优化策略</h1><p>KMenas优点：</p>
<ul>
<li>高效可伸缩，计算复杂度 为<font color="green">O(NKt)</font>接近于线性（N是数据量，K是聚类总数，t是迭代轮数）。</li>
<li><font color="green">收敛速度快</font>，原理通俗易懂，可解释性强。</li>
</ul>
<p>KMeans明显缺点：</p>
<ul>
<li>受<font color="green">初始值</font>和<font color="green">异常</font>影响，聚类结果可能不是全局最优而是<font color="green">局部最优</font>。</li>
<li><font color="green">K</font>是超参数，按<font color="green">经验选择</font></li>
<li><font color="green">样本点只能划分到单一的类中</font></li>
<li>只能发现球状的簇。</li>
<li>初始值对结果影响较大，可能每次聚类结果都不一样。</li>
</ul>
<p>根据以上特点，我们可以从下面几个角度对算法做调优</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>数据预处理：归一化和异常点过滤</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>KMeans本质是基于欧式距离度量的数据划分方法，均值和方差大的维度将对数据聚类结果产生决定性影响。</strong>聚类前对数据（<strong>具体的说是每一个维度的特征</strong>）做<font color="green">归一化</font>和<font color="green">单位统一</font>至关重要。<font color="green">异常值</font>会对均值计算产生较大影响，导致<strong>中心偏移</strong>，<font color="green">噪声点最好能提前过滤</font>。</p>
<p><strong>2.合理选择K值</strong></p>
<p>K值的选择一般基于实验和多次实验结果。例如采用<strong>手肘法</strong>，尝试不同K值并将对应的损失函数画成折线。手肘法认为图上的<strong>拐点就是K的最佳值</strong>（上图对应K=3）。</p>
<p><strong>Gap Statistic方法</strong>。只需要找到最大的Gap Statistic对应的K(自动)。</p>
<p>沿用第一节中<font color="green">损失函数</font>记为 Dk，当分为K类时，Gap Statistic定义为： Gap(k)=E(logDk)-logDk 。 E(logDk)是logDk的期望，一般由<font color="green">蒙特卡洛模拟</font>产生。在<font color="green">样本所在的区域内按照均匀分布随机地产生和原始样本数一样多的随机样本</font>，对这个<font color="green">随机样本做KMeans</font>，得到一个<font color="green">Dk</font>，<font color="green">重复多次</font>计算出 E(logDk)的近似值。</p>
<p><strong>Gap(K) 的物理含义是<font color="green">随机样本的损失与实际样本的损失之差</font>。Gap越<font color="green">大</font>说明聚类的效果越好</strong>。随着K的变化Gap(K)几乎维持一条直线保持不变。说明这些样本间没有明显的类别关系，<font color="green">数据分布几乎和均匀分布一致</font>，近似随机。此时聚类没有意义。</p>
<p><strong>3.改进初始值的选择</strong></p>
<p>采取随机选择K个中心，<font color="green">可能导致不同中心点距离很近</font>，需<font color="green">更多的迭代次数才能收敛</font>。如在选择初始中心点时<strong>不同的中心尽可能远离</strong>，效果更好。这类算法中，以K-Means++算法最具影响力。</p>
<p><strong>4.采用核函数?</strong></p>
<p>主要思想是通过一个非线性映射，将输入空间中的数据点映射到高位的特征空间中，并在新的空间进行聚类。非线性映射增加了数据点线性可分的概率（与SVM中使用核函数思想类似）对于非凸的数据分布可以达到更为准确的聚类结果。</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>从EM算法解释KMeans</li>
</ol>
<p>EM（Expectation-Maximum）算法即期望最大化算法，是最常见的隐变量估计方法。EM算法是一种迭代优化策略，每一次迭代都分为两步：期望步（E）、极大步（M）。<strong>EM算法的提出最初是为了解决数据缺失情况下的参数估计问题</strong>，基本思想是首先根据已有的观测数据，通过极大似然估计估计出模型的参数；再根据上一步估计出的参数值估计缺失数据的值；最后根据估计出的缺失数据和原有的观测数据重新对参数值进行估计，反复迭代直到收敛。</p>

    <title>ATAC-seq-5【PeakCalling-MACS2】</title>
    <url>/blog/2021/10/29/ATAC-seq-5-macs2-info/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="MACS2-detail"><a href="#MACS2-detail" class="headerlink" title="MACS2 detail"></a>MACS2 detail</h2><span id="more"></span>


<h3 id="粗略介绍MACS基本原理。"><a href="#粗略介绍MACS基本原理。" class="headerlink" title="粗略介绍MACS基本原理。"></a>粗略介绍MACS基本原理。</h3><p>TF在基因组上的结合是随机过程，基因组的每个位置都有机会结合某个TF，只是概率不一样，peak出现的位置，是TF结合热点，而peak-calling就为了找这些热点。</p>
<p>如何定义热点？通俗讲，热点是这样一些位置，这些位置多次被测得的read所覆盖（我们测的是一个细胞群体，read出现次数多，说明该位置被TF结合的几率大）。read数达到多少才叫多？就要用到统计检验。假设TF在基因组上的分布没有任何规律，那么测序得到的read在基因组上的分布也必然是随机的，某个碱基上覆盖的read的数目应服从二项分布。和抽小球的过程类似。当n很大，p很小时，二项分布近似用泊松分布替代，在这里：<br><img src="/blog/2021/10/29/ATAC-seq-5-macs2-info/1.png"></p>
<p>拉姆达是泊松分布唯一参数，n是测序read总数目，l是单个read长度，s是基因组大小。有了分布，可以算出在某个置信概率（如0.00001）下，随机情况下，某个碱基上可以覆盖的read数目的最小值，当实际观察到的read数目超过这个值（单侧检验）时，认为该碱基是TF的一个结合热点。反过来，针对每一个read数目，我们也可以算出对应的置信概率P。</p>
<p>但这只是简化模型，实际情况复杂好多。由于测序、mapping过程内在<font color="red">偏好性</font>，以及不同染色质间的差异性，相比全基因组，某些碱基可能内在地会被更多的read所覆盖，这种情况得到的很多peak可能都是假的。MACS考虑到这点，<font color="red">当对某个碱基进行假设检验，MACS只考虑该碱基附近染色质区段（如10k），此时上述公式中n表示附近10k区间内的read数目，s被置为10k</font>。当有对照组（Control，相比实验组没有用抗体捕获TF或用了一个通用抗体）存在，利用Control组的数据构建泊松分布，<font color="red">没有Control时，利用实验组，稍大一点的局部区间（比如50k）</font>的数据构建泊松分布。</p>
<p>还有一个问题，read只是跟随着TF一起沉淀下来的DNA fragment的末端，read的位置并不是真实的TF结合位置。所以在peak-calling之前，延伸read是必须的。不同TF大小不一样，对read延伸的长度也理应不同.测得的<font color="red">read最终其实会近似地平均分配到正负链</font>，对于一个TF结合热点，read在附近正负链上会近似地形成<font color="red">“双峰”</font>。MACS会以<font color="red">某个window size扫描基因组，统计每个window里面read的富集程度，然后抽取（比如1000个）合适的（read富集程度适中，过少，无法建立模型，过大，可能反映的只是某种偏好性）window作样本，建立“双峰模型”</font>。最后，两个峰之间的距离就被认为是<font color="red">TF的长度D，每个read将延伸D/2</font>。见下图：</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021/10/29/ATAC-seq-5-macs2-info/2.png"></p>
<p>当有对照组，MACS会进行两次peak calling。第一次以实验组（Treatment）为实验组，对照组为对照组，第二次颠倒，以实验组为对照组，对照组为实验组。之后，MACS对每一个P计算了相应的FDR（False Discovery Rate）值：</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2021/10/29/ATAC-seq-5-macs2-info/3.png"></p>
<p>表示第二次peak calling（颠倒的）得到的置信概率小于P的peak的个数。表示第一次peak calling得到的置信概率小于P的peak的个数。FDR综合利用了实验组和对照组的信息，显然，FDR越小越好。</p>
<h3 id="MACS-peak-calling-pipeline："><a href="#MACS-peak-calling-pipeline：" class="headerlink" title="MACS peak-calling pipeline："></a>MACS peak-calling pipeline：</h3><p>在某些情况下，如对组蛋白修饰的ChIP-seq数据peak-calling时，“双峰模型”会建立失败，<font color="red">因为组蛋白修饰往往并不是孤立存在的，可能很长一段染色质区间都被同一个组蛋白修饰占据，组蛋白修饰的peak并不典型。</font>这时，只要多加一个参数：</p>
<p><font color="red">–nomodel –shiftsize=number</font></p>
<p>–nomodel将<font color="red">略过“双峰模型”建立的过程</font>，而<font color="red">–shiftsize将人为指定reads延伸的长度</font>。<font color="red">一个核小体上大概缠绕着147bpDNA</font>，在对组蛋白修饰做peak-calling时可以指定：</p>

There are also <code>‘mixed’ binding profiles</code> which can be hard for algorithms to discern.

<h3 id="1-Remove-redundancy"><a href="#1-Remove-redundancy" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove redundancy"></a>1. Remove redundancy</h3><p><code>Why worry about duplicates?</code> <code>Reads with the same start position</code> are <code>considered duplicates</code>. These duplicates can arise from experimental artifacts, but can also contribute to genuine ChIP-signal. (相同起点的reads被认为是duplicates，可能由于实验误差造成，<code>也可能是ChIP信号</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>坏 duplicates</code>: If initial starting <code>material is low</code> this can lead to <code>overamplification</code> of this material before sequencing. Any <code>biases in PCR</code> will compound this problem and can lead to <code>artificially enriched regions</code>. Also <code>blacklisted (repeat) regions</code> with ultra high signal will also be high in duplicates. <code>Masking these regions</code> prior to analysis can help remove this problem。 实验材料量少，过度扩增，PCR偏差，人为富集区域。<code>blacklist（重复）区域？怎么获得</code>，屏蔽该区域。</li>
<li><code>好 duplicates</code>: You can expect some <code>biological duplicates with ChIP-seq</code> since you are only sequencing a small <code>part of the genome</code>. This number can increase if your depth of coverage is excessive or if your protein only binds to few sites. If there are a good proportion of biological dupicates, <code>removal</code> can lead to an <code>underestimation of the ChIP signal</code>. 有ChIP-seq意义的生物学意义duplicates ，测序基因组小部分。覆盖深度过多，蛋白质与少数位点结合，duplicates会增加。去除此类会导致对ChIP信号的低估。</li>
<li>Consider your <code>enrichment efficiency</code> and <code>sequencing depth</code>. Try to <code>discriminate</code> via genome browser of your non-deduplicated data. Bona fide peaks will have <code>multiple overlapping</code> reads with <code>offsets</code>, while samples with only PCR duplicates will stack up perfectly without offsets. A possible solution to distinguishing biological duplicate from PCR artifact would be to include UMIs into your experimental setup. 考虑<code>富集效率</code>和<code>测序深度</code>。通过<code>基因组浏览器区别</code>。<code>真正的峰</code>会有多个<code>重叠reads和偏移量</code>，<code>PCR重复没有偏移量</code>。如何区分：实验设计考虑<a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/471483238_120055884">UMIs</a>（<code>UMI将被用于合并PCR复制物</code>）。</li>
<li>Retain duplicates for differential binding analysis. 保留duplicates 用于差异结合分析 <code>why</code>？retain和keep区别？</li>
<li>If you are expecting binding in repetitive regions, use paired-end sequencing and keep duplicates. 研究重复区域，使用pariedend测序并<code>保持重复？</code></li>

<li>真实结合位点周围的tag density应显示<code>双峰富集</code>(<code>成对峰</code>)。MACS利用这种双峰模式 <code>empirically model the shifting size</code>，精确定位结合位点。</li>
<li>为了找到<code>成对峰</code>来<code>构建模型</code>，MACS首先<code>扫描整个数据集</code>，寻找<code>高度显著富集区域</code>。只利用ChIP样本，给定超声大小sonication size(<code>bandwidth</code>)和high-confidence fold-enrichment(<code>mfold</code>)， MACS <code>slides two bandwidth windows</code> across the genome to find <code>regions with tags more than mfold enriched</code> relative to a <code>random tag genome distribution</code>.</li>
<li>MACS<code>随机抽取1000个高质量峰</code>，<code>分离正链和负链标签</code>，aligns them by the midpoint between their centers。The <code>distance between the modes of the two peaks in the alignment is defined as ‘d’</code> and represents the estimated fragment length.

Mappability is related to the <code>uniqueness of the k-mers</code> at a particular position the genome. <code>Low-complexity</code> and <code>repetitive regions</code> have <code>low uniqueness</code>, which means <code>low mappability</code>. Therefore we need to provide the effective genome length to correct for the loss of true signals in low-mappable regions. 提供<code>有效基因组长度</code>，以<code>纠正低定位区域真实信号丢失</code>。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/5571c4b228cb4706805ba0853c546c3c.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述"><br><code>如何获得？</code>The MACS2 software has some <code>pre-computed values</code> for <code>commonly used</code> organisms (human, mouse, worm and fly，<code>rice？</code>). more accurate values?

The <code>tag distribution</code> along the genome can be modeled by a <code>Poisson distribution</code>.  The Poisson is a one parameter model, where the parameter <code>λ is the expected number of reads in that window</code>.</p>

The lambda parameter is estimated from the control sample and is deduced by taking the maximum value across <code>various window sizes</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>λlocal = max(λBG, λ1k, λ5k, λ10k).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way lambda <code>captures the influence of local biases</code>, and is robust against occasional low tag counts at small local regions. Possible sources for these biases include local chromatin structure, DNA amplification and sequencing bias, and genome copy number variation. 通过使用动态lambda捕获局部偏差的影响，并且对小局部区域中<code>偶尔出现的low tag counts</code>表现较好。<code>偏差可能来源</code>包括局部染色质结构、DNA扩增和测序偏差以及基因组拷贝数变化。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/3c7c645b299e45b2b7975d6327d421bc.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述"><br>A region is considered to have a <code>significant tag enrichment</code> if the <code>p-value &lt; 10e-5</code> (可设置). This is a Poisson distribution p-value based on λ.</p>
<p>Overlapping enriched peaks are merged, and each tag position is <code>extended ‘d’ bases？</code> from its center. The location in the <code>peak with the highest fragment pileup堆积</code>, hereafter referred to as the summit峰顶, is <code>predicted as the precise binding location</code>.

Methods|等位基因组组装算法hifiasm（20210202）</h2><p>paper：    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33526886/">Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly using phased assembly graphs with hifiasm</a><br>该研究提出一种全新的单倍型基因组组装算法hifiasm，能够有效地对<font color="red">大型复杂基因组生成高质量的单倍型组装结果</font>。</p>

<h3 id="单倍型组装难点"><a href="#单倍型组装难点" class="headerlink" title="单倍型组装难点"></a>单倍型组装难点</h3><p>单倍型基因组组装是研究基因组结构与变异的最理想方式。由于技术的局限，大多数组装算法倾向于将不同单倍型有损的压缩成一条混合的代表性序列。对于自然界中主流的二倍体和多倍体样本而言，这类方法损失了大量的单倍型信息。这使得长久以来，研究人员难以对高杂合、高重复的基因组进行深入的分析。</p>
<p>为了解决这个难题，一些组装算法首先生成混合的代表性序列，接着从代表性序列中恢复出不同的单倍型信息。但是，由于代表性序列本身已经丢失了大量的信息，这类方法难以获得高质量的单倍型组装结果。</p>
<p>近期的组装算法通过额外的信息，如家系(Trio binning)或者Hi-C等数据，预先全局性的将待组装的测序读段划分到不同单倍型，再进行分别组装，从而试图获得高质量的单倍型组装结果。但是对于低杂合的样本而言，这种方法难以做到完美的预先划分，因此容易产生组装错误。</p>
<h3 id="Hifiasm-算法"><a href="#Hifiasm-算法" class="headerlink" title="Hifiasm 算法"></a>Hifiasm 算法</h3><p>在本研究中，研究人员提出了一种全新的针对PacBio HiFi (High-Fidelity reads) 数据的单倍型组装算法hifiasm。该算法有两项重要创新。</p>
<p>第一，提出了单倍型敏感的组装思路，使得在组装的全过程中能够无损的保留单倍型信息，同时也极大的提升了对基因组高重复和复杂区域的解析能力。</p>
<p>第二，提出了Graph-binning的分型策略，其利用组装图的结构信息对全局分型结果进行校正，从而极大地提高了单倍型组装的质量。Graph-binning不对待组装的测序读段进行预先全局划分，因此能够克服划分错误带来组装问题。</p>
<h3 id="组装结果"><a href="#组装结果" class="headerlink" title="组装结果"></a>组装结果</h3><p>研究人员在不同的数据集上测试了hifiasm算法。对于不同大小，不同杂合度和不同单倍型数量的动物和植物基因组，hifiasm能够产生质量最高的组装结果。尤其值得注意的是，hifiasm仅用三天时间，就完成27Gb超大加州红杉基因组的组装，并且组装结果的连续性7倍于其他算法。</p>
<p>对于人类基因组，hifiasm也能取得最好的效果。相比于现有算法，hifiasm所产生的组装结果连续性最高，同时也正确解析了最多的复杂和高重复区域，如MHC (主要组织相容性复合体)和centromere (着丝端粒)。尤其对于人类二倍体样本HG002和HG00733，hifiasm产生的组装结果的连续性3倍于其他算法，并成功保留了最多的变异信息。</p>

<ul>
<li>Replicates</li>
<li>Controls：一般<code>不设置对照</code>。作用有限，费用。没有转座酶处理的样本测序</li>
<li>PCR amplification：<code>尽可能少</code>地使用<code>PCR循环</code>来扩增样本，减少干扰</li>
<li>Sequencing depth：最佳测序深度取决于<code>参考基因组的大小</code>和<code>预期染色质的开放程度</code>。人类样本的研究推荐每个样本超过5000万个reads。</li>
<li>Sequencing mode：(1) ATACseq推荐使用paired-end。paired-end sequencing, helps to <code>reduce these alignment ambiguities</code>. (2) we are interested in <code>knowing both ends of the DNA fragments generated by the assay</code>, since the ends indicate where the transposase inserted. (3) <strong><code>PCR duplicates are identified more accurately</code></strong>.  PCR duplicates are <code>artifacts of the procedure</code>, and they should be removed as part of the analysis pipeline . <code>Computational programs that remove PCR duplicates typically identify duplicates based on comparing ends of aligned reads</code>. With <strong><code>single-end reads</code></strong>, there is <code>only one position to compare</code>, and so any <code>reads whose 5&#39; ends match are considered duplicates</code>. Thus, <code>many false positives</code> may result, and perfectly <code>good reads are removed</code> from further analysis. <strong><code>Paired-end sequencing</code></strong>, <code>both ends of the original DNA fragments are defined</code>. <code>To be declared a duplicate, both ends of one fragment need to match both ends of another fragment</code>, which is far <code>less likely to occur by chance</code>. Therefore, paired-end sequencing leads to <code>fewer false positives</code>.</li>
<li>Mitochondria: 众所周知ATAC-seq数据通常包含很大比例的<code>来自线粒体DNA的reads</code>（<em>线粒体DNA是裸露的，也可以被Tn5酶识别切割，植物叶绿体</em>）。线粒体基因组中没有ATAC-seq感兴趣的峰，这些reads在计算中被丢弃，浪费测序资源。可在测序前使用洗涤剂<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4396">去除样本中的线粒体</a>。</li>

<h4 id="Genome-indexing"><a href="#Genome-indexing" class="headerlink" title="Genome indexing"></a>Genome indexing</h4><p>For many model organisms, the genome and pre-built reference indexes are available from <a href="https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html">iGenomes</a>.<br>Otherwise, Bowtie2 indexes are made from a FASTA genome file using the program <code>bowtie2-build</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">bowtie2-build  &lt;genome.fa&gt;  &lt;genomeIndexName&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h4 id="Alignment-1"><a href="#Alignment-1" class="headerlink" title="Alignment"></a>Alignment</h4><p><a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml">Bowtie2 parameters</a>. Here are a few that <code>may benefit the alignment of an ATAC-seq dataset</code> :</p>
<p><code>-X &lt;int&gt;</code> : Maximum DNA fragment length (<code>default 500bp</code>). If you anticipate that you may have DNA fragments <code>longer than</code> the default value, you should <code>increase</code> this parameter accordingly; otherwise, alignments from such fragments are considered not properly paired (see Fig. 3B below).<br><code>--very-sensitive</code> : Bowtie2 has a number of alignment and effort parameters that interact in complex (and sometimes unexpected) ways. Preset collections of these parameters are provided for convenience; the default is –sensitive, but <code>better alignment results</code> are frequently achieved with –very-sensitive.<br><code>-k &lt;int&gt;</code> : Maximum number of alignments to report per read. By default, Bowtie2 reports at most one alignment per read, and if multiple equivalent alignments exist, it chooses one randomly.<br><code>-p &lt;int&gt;</code> : Number of <code>cores</code> on which to run</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">bowtie2  --very-sensitive  -k 10  -x &lt;genomeIndexName&gt;  -1 &lt;name&gt;_1.fastq.gz  -2 &lt;name&gt;_2.fastq.gz  \</span><br><span class="line">  |  samtools view  -u  -  \</span><br><span class="line">  |  samtools sort  -n  -o &lt;BAM&gt;  -</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<ul>
<li>For input files of <code>20 million</code> paired reads, this command takes around <code>five hours</code> on Cannon(1 core too slow). One could specify eight cores for Bowtie2 with <code>-p 8</code> and adjust the request in the <code>SLURM script</code> to <code>#SBATCH -n 10</code> (that is, <code>eight</code> cores for <code>Bowtie2</code> and <code>one each</code> for <code>SAMtools view</code> and <code>sort</code>). </li>
<li>Bowtie2 also provides (via stderr) a summary of the mapping results, separated according to uniqueness and alignment type.</li>

The reads <code>may overlap</code> to some extent (bottom). <strong>B</strong>: A read alignment (for <code>R1</code>) can be <code>unpaired</code> for several reasons: if the read’s mate (<code>R2</code>) is <code>unaligned</code> (<code>upper left</code>), <code>aligns to a different chromosome</code> (<code>upper right</code>), aligns in the <code>incorrect orientation</code> (<code>middle</code> cases), or aligns in the correct orientation but at an <code>invalid distance</code> (<code>bottom</code>). In all cases except the upper left, the R2 read alignment is also unpaired, and the read pair align discordantly (though Bowtie2 also requires uniqueness for such alignments to be counted as discordant).</p>

<h3 id="Peak-calling"><a href="#Peak-calling" class="headerlink" title="Peak calling"></a>Peak calling</h3><h4 id="推荐新的Generich"><a href="#推荐新的Generich" class="headerlink" title="推荐新的Generich???"></a>推荐新的<a href="https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich"><code>Generich</code></a>???</h4><p>Genrich was designed to be able to <code>run all of the post-alignment steps</code> through <code>peak-calling with one command</code>. It also possesses a few <code>novel features</code>. Consider the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of mitochondrial reads</strong>. Genrich <code>disregards all alignments to the mitochondrial</code> chromosome with <code>-e chrM</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Removal of PCR duplicates</strong>. Genrich follows a <code>systematic procedure</code> to <code>remove PCR duplicates</code> with <code>-r</code>. Note that this evaluation <code>takes into account multimapping reads</code> (see next), which is <code>not provided by other alignment-based duplicate-removal programs</code>, such as <code>Picard&#39;s MarkDuplicates</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis of multimapping reads</strong>. 重复区域多的基因组可能导致非唯一mapping。 Non-uniquely aligned reads can be removed by filtering based on MAPQ scores with <code>samtools</code>, but this effectively renders certain genomic regions inaccessible to the assay. With Genrich, <code>reads with multiple alignments are analyzed</code> by adding a fractional count to each location. Genrich’s <code>statistical model</code> accommodates these values.<br>Along these same lines, Genrich considers the entire reference genome to be part of the assay. If there are chromosomes or genomic regions that should be excluded from analysis, these can be specified by <code>-e or -E</code>, and Genrich will adjust the <code>genome length calculation</code> accordingly. There is no need to <code>guesstimate an &quot;effective&quot; genome size</code> like with MACS2.<br><strong>Analysis of multiple replicates</strong>. When alignment files for multiple replicates are provided to Genrich, it <code>calls peaks for the replicates collectively</code>. <code>No more IDR</code>. Done.<br><strong>Interpretation of alignments suitable for ATAC-seq</strong>. Genrich provides an ATAC-seq analysis mode (-j) in which, rather than inferring the full fragments from the alignments, intervals are interpreted that are centered on transposase cut sites (the ends of each DNA fragment). Only properly paired alignments are analyzed by default, but there is an option to consider unpaired alignments as well (-y) (Fig. 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/abb30e7406834c91b7e456ff14e23742.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_20,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="请添加图片描述"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our previous recommendation was to run <code>MACS2</code> with <code>-f BAMPE</code>, which is similar to the <code>default analysis mode of Genrich</code> (<strong>inferring full fragments, rather than cut site intervals</strong>). Others have attempted to interpret cut site intervals with MACS2 by using the <code>--shif</code>t and <code>--extsize</code> arguments, but these arguments are ignored in <code>BAMPE</code> mode. They do work in the default (<code>BAM</code>) mode, but then, with paired-end reads, <code>most of the alignments are automatically discarded</code> (half of the properly paired alignments and all of the unpaired alignments; secondary alignments are never considered). Is it worse to interpret full fragments that may be less informative biologically, or to disregard more than half of the sequence data? A complicated question. The correct answer is: <strong>use Genrich.</strong><h4 id="Genrich"><a href="#Genrich" class="headerlink" title="Genrich"></a>Genrich</h4></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>most important parameters and options of Genrich for analyzing ATAC-seq：</strong> </p>
<p><code>-j</code> : ATAC-seq mode (<strong>must</strong> be specified)<br><code>-d &lt;int&gt;</code> : Expand cut sites to the given length (default 100bp)<br><code>-y</code> : Analyze <strong>unpaired</strong> alignments<br><code>-r</code> : Remove PCR duplicates<br><code>-e &lt;arg&gt;</code> : Chromosomes (reference sequences) to exclude. Can be a comma-separated list, e.g. <code>-e chrM,chrY</code>.<br><code>-E &lt;file&gt;</code> : Input BED file(s) of genomic regions to exclude, such as ‘N’ homopolymers or high mappability regions<br><code>-q &lt;float&gt;</code> : Maximum q-value (FDR-adjusted p-value) for peak calling (default 0.05). An unadjusted p-value threshold can be used instead with <code>-p &lt;float&gt;</code>.<br><code>-a &lt;float&gt;</code> : Minimum area under the curve (total significance) for a peak (default 20.0). <code>Increasing</code> this value results in <code>fewer</code> but <code>higher confidence</code> peaks.<br><code>-v</code> : Verbose mode</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Genrich  -t &lt;BAM&gt;  -o &lt;OUT&gt;  -j  -y  -r  -e chrM  -v</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<ul>
<li>对于重复data,  <code>-t &lt;BAM1&gt;,&lt;BAM2&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The output file produced by Genrich is in <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12"><code>ENCODE narrowPeak format</code></a>, listing the genomic coordinates of each peak called and various statistics.</li>
<li>Speed： a single BAM containing <code>146.3 million alignments</code> was analyzed by Genrich in <code>10.5min</code> with <code>17.1GB of memory</code> . In general, input BAM(s) of more alignments take longer to analyze, but the memory usage should not increase greatly. Note that <code>Genrich is not multithreaded</code>, so it runs on a single core only.</li>
<li>Those who wish to explore the results of varying the <code>peak-calling parameters (-q/-p, -a, -l, -g)</code> should consider having Genrich produce a log file when it parses the SAM/BAM files (for example, with <code>-f &lt;LOG&gt;</code> added to the above command). Then, Genrich can call peaks directly from the log file with the <code>-P</code> option（调参数使用此法节省内存和时间）:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Genrich  -P  -f &lt;LOG&gt;  -o &lt;OUT2&gt;  -p 0.01  -a 200  -v</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Add header.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">track type=narrowPeak</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>An alternative visualization tool is the <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)</a>. Peak files can be loaded directly (File → Load from File). <strong>Viewing BAM files with IGV requires that they be sorted by coordinate and indexed</strong> using <a href="http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html">SAMtools</a>. However, the BAMs show the read alignments, <code>not the full fragments generated by the ATAC</code> <code>nor the cut site intervals</code> analyzed by Genrich. To view the intervals, one can use the optional output <code>BED file</code> produced by Genrich with <code>-b</code>.</p>
<h4 id="Comparing-peak-files"><a href="#Comparing-peak-files" class="headerlink" title="Comparing peak files"></a>Comparing peak files</h4><p>Determining genomic regions that are <code>common or different to a set of peak files</code> is best accomplished with <a href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">BEDTools</a>, a suite of software tools that enables “genome arithmetic.”<br>For example, <a href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html">bedtools intersect</a> determines regions that are <strong><code>common</code></strong> to two peak files. Finding <strong><code>differences</code></strong> between two peak files, such as control vs. experimental groups, is accomplished via <a href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/subtract.html">bedtools subtract</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Annotation"><a href="#Annotation" class="headerlink" title="Annotation"></a>Annotation</h4><p>It is helpful to know <code>what genomic features are near the peaks</code> called by Genrich. One program that is commonly used to annotate peaks is <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html">ChIPseeker</a>. ChIPseeker was originally designed to be used in the analysis of ChIP-seq, but it works just <code>as well with ATAC-seq.</code><br>ChIPseeker <strong>requires</strong> that the <code>genome of interest be annotated with locations of genes and other features</code>. The <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ChIPseeker/inst/doc/ChIPseeker.html">ChIPseeker user guide</a> is extremely helpful in using this R/Bioconductor package.</p>
<h4 id="Motif-finding"><a href="#Motif-finding" class="headerlink" title="Motif finding"></a>Motif finding</h4><p><a href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/introduction/basics.html">HOMER</a> is a suite of software designed for <a href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/ngs/peakMotifs.html">motif discovery</a>. It takes a <code>peak file as input</code> and <code>checks for the enrichment</code> of both <code>known sequence motifs</code> and <code>de novo motifs</code>.</p>

<li>ATAC-seq datasets usually contain a large percentage of reads that are derived from mitochondrial DNA (<a href="http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35318">discussion</a>). Using <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02547-w">CRISPR to reduce mitochondrial contamination</a>. Or recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4396">Omni-ATAC method</a> uses detergents[洗涤剂] to remove mitochondria and is likely to be more accessible for most researchers ( <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/496521v1">bad computational workflow</a>).</li>
<li>Method 1 : <strong>Remove the mitochondrial genome from the reference genome before aligning the reads</strong>. In human/mouse genome builds, the mitochondrial genome is labeled ‘<code>chrM</code>‘. That sequence can be deleted from the reference prior to building the genome indexes. The downside of this approach is that the alignment numbers will look much worse; all of the mitochondrial reads will count as unaligned. [植物？]</li>
<li>Method 2 : <strong>Remove the mitochondrial reads after alignment</strong>. A python script, creatively named removeChrom, is available in the ATAC-seq module to accomplish this. For example, to remove all ‘chrM’ reads from a BAM file, one would run this:</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Non-unique-alignments"><a href="#Non-unique-alignments" class="headerlink" title="Non-unique alignments"></a>Non-unique alignments</h5><p>重复区域多的参考序列可能导致reads多处mapping. 用samtools view的-q <code>去除非唯一比对</code>. For reads with multiple alignments, <code>Bowtie2</code> (or <code>BWA</code>) will <code>report only one alignment</code> (by <code>default</code>) and will assign it a low mapping quality (MAPQ) score, which is defined as -10 * log10Pr{mapping position is wrong}. To eliminate alignments with <code>MAPQ &lt; 10</code> (i.e., where <code>Bowtie2</code> has determined <code>Pr&#123;mapping position is wrong&#125; &gt; 0.1</code>), one would run the following:</p>

<h4 id="Peak-calling-1"><a href="#Peak-calling-1" class="headerlink" title="Peak calling"></a>Peak calling</h4><ul>
<li>Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (<a href="https://github.com/taoliu/MACS">MACS2</a>) is a program for detecting regions of <code>genomic enrichment</code>. Though designed for ChIP-seq, it works just <code>as well on ATAC-seq and other genome-wide enrichment assays that have narrow peaks</code>. The main program in MACS2 is <code>callpeak</code>, and its options are described below. (Note that the latest version of MACS2 on Odyssey (v2.1.2_dev) is different from the updated official MACS2 release (v2.1.2), although the latter does incorporate many of the bug fixes made in the Odyssey <code>version？</code>.)</li>
<li>It is important to remember that the <code>read alignments indicate only a portion of the DNA fragments generated by the ATAC？</code>. Therefore, one must consider how one wants MACS2 to interpret the alignments.<h5 id="Alignments-to-analyze"><a href="#Alignments-to-analyze" class="headerlink" title="Alignments to analyze"></a>Alignments to analyze</h5></li>
<li>alignments分为两类：”<strong>properly paired</strong>“ and “<strong>singletons</strong>“ 。<code>-f</code> 选择其类型。</li>
<li><strong>Analyze only properly paired alignments, but ignore R2 reads and treat R1 reads as singletons</strong>. This is the default option (<code>-f AUTO</code>). MACS2 creates a model of the fragment lengths and extends the 3’ ends of the R1 reads to the calculated average length. An alternative is to skip this model building and instead extend each read to a specified length (e.g., <code>--nomodel --extsize 300</code> for 300bp fragments). The value of the length parameter is usually determined from the average size during library preparation (the default value is 200bp if no value is specified). However, <code>neither of these approaches utilizes the value of paired-end sequencing</code>, which defines both fragment ends.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze only properly paired alignments with <code>-f BAMPE</code></strong>. Here, the fragments are defined by the paired alignments’ ends, and there is <code>no modeling or artificial extension</code>. Singleton alignments are ignored. This is the <code>preferred option</code> for using only properly paired alignments.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze all alignments</strong>. For this approach, a python script, SAMtoBED, is available in the ATAC-seq module. This script converts the read alignments to BED intervals, treating the properly paired alignments as such and extending the singleton alignments as specified. There are <code>four options for the singletons</code>: ignore them, keep them as is, extend them to an arbitrary length (similar to the <code>--extsize</code> option of MACS2), or extend them to the average length calculated from the properly paired alignments. </li>
<li>Here is an example command, using the “extend to average length” option (<code>-x</code>):</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">samtools view -h  &lt;BAM&gt;  |  SAMtoBED  -i -  -o &lt;BED&gt;  -x  -v</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The output from SAMtoBED is a <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED file</a> that should be analyzed by MACS2 with <code>-f BEDPE</code>.<br>(Note that the BEDTools program <a href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/bamtobed.html">
</a> cannot be used here, since its output is in a nonstandard BED format that MACS2 cannot analyze.)</p>
<ul>
<li>In deciding among these analysis options, it may help to consider the counts produced by Bowtie2, which indicate <code>how many alignments fall into each category</code>. For example, if most of the reads are aligned in proper pairs, it may be sufficient to use <code>option #2</code>. On the other hand, <code>option #3</code> is preferred if a substantial fraction of the reads consists of singletons.<h5 id="Other-arguments"><a href="#Other-arguments" class="headerlink" title="Other arguments"></a>Other arguments</h5></li>
<li>MACS2 is <code>not multithreaded</code></li>

<p><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2eb44c70d00b45bab31b0eb915e91cac.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></p>
<ul>
<li>为何同样DNA序列的细胞的表型会不同，为何肝细胞是肝细胞，神经细胞是神经细胞？是什么造成了他们生产蛋白不同，决定蛋白生成的RNA不同呢？原因可以用<code>表观遗传</code>来解释。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/9bf2e2d5d25a4e2eab27321b99b0b0b8.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_15,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>
<li>DNA转录成RNA过程复杂，包括：<code>染色质可及性</code>，<code>DNA修饰</code>，<code>组蛋白修饰</code>等等（选择性表达）。</li>
<li><code>染色质可及性即DNA开放区域</code>，尤为重要。<code>核小体</code>由<code>8个组蛋白</code>组成复合物，每个核小体约<code>147bpDNA</code>。转录时DNA将从核小体复合物松开。许多因素，如<code>染色质结构</code>、<code>核小体位置</code>和<code>组蛋白修饰</code>，在染色质的组织和可及性起重要作用。致密核小体结构被破坏后，<code>启动子、增强子、绝缘子、沉默子</code>等<code>顺式调控元件和反式作用因子可以接近</code>的特性，叫<code>染色质的可及性</code>，也叫<code>染色质开放性</code>(chromatin accessibility ），这段区域叫开放染色质（open chromatin） 。</li>
<li>什么是组蛋白修饰<ul>
<li>定义：组蛋白包含5个部分，按分子量大小分别称为<code>H1，H3，H2A，H2B和H4</code>。组蛋白在相关酶作用下发生<code>甲基化，乙酰化，磷酸化，腺苷酸化，泛素化，ADP核糖基化</code>等修饰</li>
<li><code>H3·H4乙酰化</code>形成<code>开放染色质结构</code>，<code>增加基因表达</code></li>
<li>组蛋白<code>甲基化</code>修饰多发生在<code>H3H4</code>，与基因<code>抑制及激活</code>相关，取决于被<code>修饰位置和程度</code></li>
<li>组蛋白<code>磷酸化</code>修饰一般与基因<code>活化</code>有关</li>
<li>组蛋白<code>泛素化</code>则是<code>启动基因表达</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2013年由斯坦福大学William J. Greenleaf和Howard Y. Chang实验室开发的ATAC-seq（<code>Assay</code> for <code>Transposase</code>-<code>Accessible</code> <code>Chromatin</code> with high throughput sequencing），一种捕获染色质可及性（染色质开放性）的测序方法。</li>
<li>ATAC-seq<code>检测染色质可及性</code>，<code>确定基因表达调控机制</code>。识别<code>启动子区域</code>、<code>潜在的增强子或抑制子</code>。<code>启动子</code>是靠近转录起始点(TSS)的DNA区域。包含<code>转录因子的结合位点</code>，转录因子招募RNA聚合酶。<code>增强子</code>是位于<code>启动子下游或上游1Mb</code>的DNA区域。<code>当转录因子与增强子结合，并与启动子区域接触时，该基因的转录增加</code>。相反<code>抑制子</code>会<code>减少或抑制基因表达</code>。</li>
<li>ATAC-seq的<code>峰</code>往往是<code>启动子</code>，<code>增强子序列</code>以及一些<code>反式调控因子</code>结合位点。</li>
<li>为找到开放染色质区，基因组被<code>TN5转座酶</code>处理。在ATAC-Seq中，<code>修饰后的TN5将与NextEra接头相对应的DNA序列插入到基因组的开放区域</code>，同时，DNA被转座酶活性剪切。</li>
<li>开放染色质的研究方法除了ATAC-seq，还有DNase-Seq，FAIRE-seq，MNase-seq 等。ATAC-Seq<code>所需样本少，建库快，重复性更高</code></li>
<li>技术：制备细胞悬液-&gt;裂解细胞膜，获取细胞核-&gt;采用Tn5进行酶切-&gt;回收DNA片段，PCR扩增建库-&gt;高通量测序-&gt;生信分析</li>
<li><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/00f06cb4758b44c7a35b8c5c3ff74eda.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_20,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>
<li><code>ATAC-seq</code>与<code>Chip-seq</code> call出来的<code>peak</code>代表的<code>意义不同</code>。<code>Chip-seq</code> peak是被<code>目的蛋白结合拉下来的DNA</code>，一般只有<code>一个峰</code>，而<code>ATAC-seq</code>是被<code>Tn5转座酶切开</code>、没有被组蛋白结合、染色质开放的DNA位点，<code>如果是TF结合的区域，一般会有一个山谷般的存在</code>。ChIP-seq和ATAC-seq在TF或者Tn5结合区域<code>都会形成一个双峰的reads结合模式</code>，但<code>判断peak的时会有不同的标准</code>。chip-seq是由于<code>TF一起沉淀下来的DNA fragment一般会大于TF的结合区域</code>，<code>read的位置并不是真实TF结合位置</code>，需要<code>向内shift</code>；而<code>ATAC-seq一般是往两边shift</code>。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/e501e5a398b34d0e8fd514fba8333cdb.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_20,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>
<li><code>ATAC-seq</code>与<code>Chip-seq</code>应用上的区别:</li>
<li>ATAC-Seq可<code>检测全基因组DNA结合蛋白</code>，<code>转录结合位点</code> ，一般用于<code>不知道特定的转录因子</code>，用此方法与其他方法结合<code>筛查感兴趣的特定调控因子</code>；</li>
<li>ChIP-Seq是已知转录因子，根据<code>感兴趣的转录因子设计抗体</code>去做ChIP实验<code>富集结合的DNA片段</code>。在测定转录因子的 ChIP-seq 中<code>独有的峰可能是先驱转录因子</code>，其<code>先结合到封闭染色质</code>，然后<code>招募染色质重塑因子或其他转录因子起始转录</code>。这些转录因子 <code>ATAC-seq检测不到</code>。</li>
<li>得到DNA片段后，为测序准备建库，包括<code>用完整的NextEra接头</code>和<code>纯化</code>、<code>PCR扩增</code>等。基于上述原因，<code>ATAC-Seq推荐使用双端配对</code>的方法。</li>

<ul>
<li>ATAC-seq的优点：<code>Tn5转座酶的高活性</code>使ATAC-seq简单，省时，而且只需500-50,000个细胞。灵敏度特异性与DNase-seq相当，优于FAIRE-seq。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="整合分析"><a href="#整合分析" class="headerlink" title="整合分析"></a>整合分析</h3><ul>
<li>由于开放染色质是大多数TF结合的先决条件，因此<code>ATAC-seq峰通常与TF ChIP-seq峰重叠，但通常更宽</code>。因此，<code>TF ChIP-seq和ATAC-seq可以在同一实验系统中相互验证</code>彼此的质量和可靠性。 </li>
<li>ATAC-seq与 histone marker ChIP-seq集成，发现与活跃染色质标 H3K4me3，H3K4me1，H3K27ac等正相关，与不活跃的染色质标记 H3K27me3 负相关。 <code>？</code></li>
<li><code>ATAC-seq+RNA-seq</code>： 一般RNA-seq会优先于ATAC-seq先测，但<code>差异基因富集的基因通路只是一种相关性</code>。要分析出其中谁调控目的基因，可通过<code>ATAC-seq做motif分析</code>，<code>寻找潜在的调控因子</code>，然后再后续的<code>实验验证</code>或者<code>chip-seq验证</code>。/ 看ATAC上丰度高的DNA序列区域是否对应转录本表达量增加，找到对应转录本相关基因的上游调控序列，整体分析转录。对基因功能分析，结合实验表型，推测表达调控-表达-功能-表型。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/4a3016bfa5c74598a5b7d660fe1cfe84.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_20,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>
<li><code>ATAC-seq+HiC</code>： 对于一些想了解<code>染色质高级结构对生命行为的作用</code>的时候，通常会需要用到ATAC-seq等技术，因为<code>Hi-C分析</code>得到高级结构compartmentA/B、TADs、Loops等信息，通常只是相关性，但通过ATAC-seq，可以<code>获得promoter、enhancer等信息</code>，更能知道高级结构是如何影响启动子、增强子从而影响基因表达的。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/e38ba32597a14ca7a5d4d6b2f36c1b73.png" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>
<li><code>ATAC-seq+组蛋白修饰</code>： ATAC-seq预测一个位点的开放程度以及可能有某种转录因子的结合，但<code>不知道</code>该因子是<code>促进</code>基因表达，还是<code>抑制</code>，只通过<code>基因层面鉴定</code>来判断转录因子对基因的促进或者是不够的，它只是一种<code>相关性</code>。而这时候如果能提供像<code>H3K27ac这类激活型组蛋白</code>、<code>H3K27me3这类抑制型组蛋白</code>将能使数据结果可信。国内较早研究iPSCs的学者如裴端卿的工作可以看到，在解析iPSCs重编程中的染色质可及性的时候，不仅用到ATAC-seq来描述细胞的身份转变，还<code>通过H3K27ac指征该区域的激活</code>。其中一篇还通过<code>调控成纤维细胞关键基因启动子区去乙酰化修饰</code>，达到了促进重编程的进程。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/abb3dc6c3bb0476985a9f1b2e77c4fcc.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_20,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>
<li><code>scATAC-seq+scRNA-seq</code>： 更前沿的技术一个细胞里同时进行RNA-seq和ATAC-seq，并且是单细胞水平的检测。SHARE-seq，能够实现在单细胞中同时高质量，高通量的检测基因表达和染色质可及性。该技术可以使用<code>染色质潜力算法</code>（chromatin potential），<code>用ATAC和RNA的差异来预测细胞的变化方向</code>。<code>相对于以往仅依赖于RNA的预测手段，染色质潜力能够大大提前预测的时间</code>。<br><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/df76c6e5f3184d58a00a1fa53a398cd5.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZHJvaWRzYW5zZmFsbGJhY2s,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBAYmFubmVyRHI=,size_19,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16" alt="在这里插入图片描述"></li>

<li>数据预处理<ul>
<li>（1）比对前质量控制FastQC</li>
<li>（2）原始序列比对 </li>
<li>（3）比对后处理和质量控制：去除重复序列，细胞器序列<ul>
<li>序列比对后，Picard/SAMtools收集unique mapping reads/rate，duplicated rate百分比和片段大小分布</li>
<li>成功的ATACseq实验应生成<code>片段大小分布图</code>（从<code>bam文件</code>得到），具有递减性和周期性的峰，对应于<code>无核小体区域</code>（NFR）（&lt;100bp）和<code>单核双核和三核</code>小体（200，400，600bp）。大多数Linker DNA大小介于10-80bp间，故大多数片段都会是<code>小于100bp</code>。每个Nucleosome的DNA大小为180bp，加上两边插入的冗余，会得到大约<code>200bp</code>长度的mono-nucleosome的DNA。</li>
<li><code>无核小体区域的片段应该在基因的转录起始位点（TSS）周围富集</code>，而<code>核小体结合区域片段TSS处形成低谷</code>，TSS周围<code>侧翼区域稍微富集</code>。<code>ATACseqQC评估</code>。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peak-calling：从比对得到的bam文件找出reads覆盖区，就是峰出现的位置。</li>
<li>高级分析<ul>
<li>（1）peak 差异分析：寻找不同分组差异peaks</li>
<li>（2）peak注释：峰的注释可将染色质的可及性与基因调控联系。通常峰会被注释到最接近的基因或调控原件。获得最接近的基因列表后，使用GOKEGGReactome等数据库功能富集分析</li>
<li>（3）motif富集分析：得到每个peak region里motif的位置和频率，再和随机背景或其他条件比较，可做motif富集分析</li>
<li>（4）footprint分析 ：ATACseq中footprint指一个TF结合在DNA上，组织Tn5切割，在染色质开放区域留下一个相对缺失的位置。而TF周围的组蛋白因为TF造成空间的推挤反而形成开放度较高区域。</li>
